# Problem 68. “Wet goose?”

Australian naturalist K. Lorenz conducted an experiment: he took goslings that had just hatched from eggs in an incubator, and began to walk with them instead of the goose. It turned out that the feathers of goslings left without a mother get wet in water, while the feathers of goslings with their mother do not get wet. Why? What experiments need to be carried out to test the hypotheses obtained? Lorenz tried to lubricate the goslings with fat, but this did not help much.
