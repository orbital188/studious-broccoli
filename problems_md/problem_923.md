# Problem 1153. “And deer are better!”

The peoples of the Far North have long had a widespread reindeer herding industry. Reindeer sleds were used as a means of transportation. The reindeer that were harnessed to the sleds were usually castrated to make them obedient. The Sami did not have veterinary medicine. Reindeer whose testicles were completely removed with a knife sometimes became infected with infectious diseases and died. The Sami found a way to deal with this. How did the Sami castrate their reindeer?
