# Problem 846. Secret Copy

Russian scientist, engineer, inventor, shipbuilder Alexey Nikolaevich Krylov (1863 - 1945) studied at the Naval School in his youth. Then, exam papers for the naval cadet corps were printed the day before the exam in the school’s printing house by one officer, who was supposed to be assisted by two students. These assistants were not allowed to take absolutely anything unnecessary with them into the printing house. They were even searched at the exit so that they would not take away the prints or the proofs themselves from which the questions were printed. However, despite this, Krylov, who turned out to be one of the officer’s assistants, came up with a way to copy the proofs. How did he do it?
