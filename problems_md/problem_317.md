# Problem 397. “Pharaoh “Narmer”

Who among the greats of this world would not want to leave their name in history. Five thousand years ago, a pharaoh named Narmer ruled in Egypt. He won many victories and wanted these victories to be forever etched in stone. Skilled craftsmen depicted the pharaoh and the killed enemies and captives. They even showed with the help of drawings that there were six thousand prisoners. But they could not convey the name of Narmer himself. And for him this was the most important thing. After all, there was no writing then, only drawings and hieroglyphs. How was it possible to preserve the name of the pharaoh through the centuries?
