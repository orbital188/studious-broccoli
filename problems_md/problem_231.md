# Problem 294. “Heating steel billets”

It is necessary to heat steel blanks to 1000-1200°C for pressure treatment. But at temperatures above 800°C, the surface of the workpieces intensively oxidizes and carbon, a component of steel, burns out of it. It is necessary to prevent surface oxidation by maintaining the method of heating workpieces by contact or induction methods. It should be borne in mind that the use of coatings and coatings is undesirable. The use of a protective (inert) atmosphere complicates the process. What to do? Source: Sat.
