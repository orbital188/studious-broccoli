# Problem 406. “Artificial leg”

When using prosthetic legs, it is very important that the artificial leg is exactly like the other, living one. It would seem that this is not difficult to do - take a cast of a living leg and cast an artificial one on it. But it doesn’t work out that way, because no one needs two left or two right legs.
