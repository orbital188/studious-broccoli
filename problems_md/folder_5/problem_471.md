# Problem 471. “Three turtles”

Three turtles crawl in a straight line (for example, along a board). The first one says: “Two turtles are crawling behind me.” The second one says: “One turtle is crawling behind me.” The third says: “Two turtles are crawling behind me.” All three turtles are telling the truth. How can this be?
