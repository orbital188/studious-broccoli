# Problem 492. “Method for disinfecting drinking water”

The most convenient way to disinfect water is with chlorine. And this poison has to be delivered in cylinders or barrels from afar. Transporting chlorine thousands of kilometers from the supplier plant is troublesome. It is impossible to store poison cylinders at stations without complying with strict safety standards. It becomes very difficult to apply chlorination in rural and sparsely populated areas. Thus, if chlorine is used to disinfect water, then the necessary purification of water from harmful impurities occurs, but chlorine is a strong poison, and problems arise with its storage and storage.
