# Problem 434. “Open your face…”

Most Indians do not have passports. Hence the fraud at the ballot box. India's Chief Election Commissioner decided to introduce photo ID cards throughout the country. However, the Muslim clergy opposed this initiative. According to Sharia law, it is unacceptable for a woman in a burqa to reveal her face to an unknown man, be it a photographer, a police officer or an official issuing ballots. How to prevent fraud at the ballot box without violating Sharia law?
