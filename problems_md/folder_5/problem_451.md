# Problem 451. “To hew or not to hew?”

Pavement stones - what could be simpler? However, even this unsightly object can become the subject of a heated dispute. When the municipality of the Dominican city of San Francisco de Macoris decided to pave the main street, the entire population was divided into two warring camps. The first argued that pavement stones should be hewn: it was more convenient and more modern. The second - traditionalists - argue that they should not be crowded: this, they say, will disrupt the historically established appearance of the city center. What should the city fathers do? You need to pave the street, but just as much you want peace and the absence of conflicts.
