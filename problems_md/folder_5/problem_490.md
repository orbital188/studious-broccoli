# Problem 490. “Crazy people bite”

In a psychiatric hospital there is a chief doctor and many crazy people. For a week, each crazy person bit someone (possibly himself) once a day. At the end of the week, it turned out that each patient had two bites, and the chief doctor had a hundred bites. How many crazy people are there in the hospital?
