# Problem 485. “With the flag through life”

At a meeting of the St. Petersburg City Council, one of the deputies began waving a flag with symbols not established by law. The leader of the meeting demanded that the flag be removed from the hall. The movie cameras immediately stared at the deputy. The “flag bearer” was clearly not going to give up his sudden popularity so easily. How to avoid a scandal?
