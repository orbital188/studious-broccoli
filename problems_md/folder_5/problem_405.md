# Problem 405. Balls at Customs

The customs officer, where the control of goods sent abroad was carried out, seemed suspicious to plastic skittle balls from one of the companies. They weighed the same as wood of the same size. The balls were not massive, but the walls were equally hard everywhere. The employee thought that inside each ball there was a cavity where contraband goods could be hidden. And, indeed, using a very simple experiment without the use of special equipment, the customs officer established that contraband was hidden in one of the 12 balls. When the ball was opened, it turned out to be a diamond jewelry. How did you manage to discover this ball? Source: Creative association “Flight of Thought” (Chelyabinsk)
