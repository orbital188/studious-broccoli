# Problem 1116. “All to the front!”

In ancient times, wars between peoples and states were not a rare phenomenon. When such periods occur, the country often announced a general mobilization of the male population to strengthen the army. But not every civilian sought to shed his blood on the battlefield. Therefore, as has happened at all times, some men were reluctant to respond to the call for general mobilization. In the state of the ancient Gauls, morals reigned quite cruel. And the priests, who actually ruled the people, found a fail-safe way to quickly mobilize warriors in the event of war. How did they manage to do this?
