# Problem 1031. “About life in the Gulag”

During the Gulag, the son of one of the prisoners asked his father in a letter about his life in prison. Naturally, my father could not write directly about the slave conditions of his existence: all the letters were read. However, he still managed to talk very figuratively, succinctly and truthfully about his life. What did the father write to his son?
