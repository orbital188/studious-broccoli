# Problem 598. Client? Take off your clothes!

What's going on in the world is just a nightmare! It’s scary to say that such persecution was carried out on the unfortunate prostitutes over the hill. The police adopted the habit of pretending to be clients and ingratiating themselves with naive night butterflies. And as soon as the girl sets an amount for her services, she’s like a “client” right there, rrrr! - and snaps the handcuffs on the poor thing. What should moths do?
