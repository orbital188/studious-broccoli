# Problem 1157. “Speaks and shows...”

At the beginning of the 20th century, during the filming of the first sound films, both image and sound were recorded on film. Technologically it was quite expensive. The quality of the film suffered - sometimes the sound was too loud, sometimes the image was overexposed. In the 1920s, they began to record images separately and sound separately. But a problem arose: it was necessary to combine sound and image during editing so that everything looked natural on the screen. How did filmmakers solve this problem?
