# Problem 79. Dishwasher Dog

When the Quonab Indian thought it was necessary to wash the dishes, he put them on the ground and let his dog Skookum lick them. This method completely satisfied Quoneb and delighted the dog, but the 12-year-old boy Rolf did not like it. However, the Indian told him: “Skookum eats the same food as we do.” You argue because you don’t understand anything. Rolf was washing the dishes “washed” by the dog, and Quonab’s uncleanliness irritated him. How can you make sure that the Indian himself never lets the dog lick the dishes again?
