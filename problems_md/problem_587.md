# Problem 744. “If you were the director?”

Richard III from Shakespeare's play of the same name is a villain who mocks those around him. His former friends, allies, courtiers - all experience Richard's treachery and malice. Imagine that you are a director and want to stage this play, but in a completely different interpretation. You need to move on to the anti-theme, whitewash Richard, make him a decent person. (This would correspond to the historical truth. Richard III was not a villain. He was a deeply decent man, very democratically minded. By the way, he was not hunchbacked). The action of the play cannot be changed: Richard must do everything that Shakespeare prescribed. How would you stage the play?
