# Problem 561. Method of transportation of associated gas

Almost all oil fields used to have fire flares burning associated gas. On the one hand, it is fire and explosive, it had to be removed somewhere. On the other hand, there was little of it, and there was no point in building special gas pipelines. Suggest a profitable method of transporting associated gas. Source: Sat. RTEZ 1999, Ed.
