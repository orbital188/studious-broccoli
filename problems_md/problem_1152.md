# Problem 1394. “To one of two”

One married couple gave birth to twin boys. Soon, one of the children was diagnosed with a disease, for the treatment of which the child needed to be given medicine every two hours. The question arose for parents: how to distinguish between twins? We tried to dress it differently, cut it differently, even mark it with a marker. But the marker washed off, clothes needed to be changed often, and my hair grew back quickly. The problem became especially acute after the grandmother gave medicine to the wrong boy, and he had to be urgently hospitalized. How can parents determine exactly which twin to give the medicine to?
