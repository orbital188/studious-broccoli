# Problem 404. “Oxidation of nitric oxide”

Oxidation of nitric oxide(2) with air is technically simple and cheap. However, the resulting nitrogen dioxide is highly diluted with atmospheric nitrogen. The low concentration of nitrogen dioxide does not allow the production of high concentration nitric acid (63% acid is formed in the conventional process). The use of pure oxygen greatly complicates and increases the cost of the process: 2 NO + O2 => 2 NO2. Suggest a simple way to obtain concentrated (100%) acid. Source: Sat.
