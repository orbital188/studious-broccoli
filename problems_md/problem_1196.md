# Problem 1442. “Pipeline along the bottom of a reservoir”

In the gas, oil and other industries, they often resort to laying pipelines along the bottom of various bodies of water. But when laying a pipeline, the problem of joining pipes under water arises: if there is water in the pipe, the pipe sinks, if there is air in the pipe, it floats. How to immerse two pipes to the bottom of a reservoir and connect there so that as a result there is no water in them, and a person can move from one pipe to another?
