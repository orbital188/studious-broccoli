# Problem 874. “Dancing into the distance”

18 century. Europe. Theater. Ballet. New production of the ballet stage. Problem: It is necessary for a group of people to move away from the stage into the distance for a long distance. But the size of the stage is small and the height of the artists does not decrease in front of the audience, as should happen when they are actually moving away over a long distance. And the French choreographer Jean Georges Noverre wants everything in this scene to be “like in life.” Of course, it is possible to seriously reconstruct the theater stage. But this is expensive and very inconvenient for a theater where various productions are constantly on. What should a choreographer do?
