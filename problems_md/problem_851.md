# Problem 1074. “Flying over the North Pole”

In mid-June 1937, the crew of the ANT-25 aircraft, consisting of V.P. Chkalova, G.F. Baidukova and A.V. Belyakov made the first non-stop flight from the USSR to the USA. During a short “shaving” flight over the North Pole, the unexpected happened: the pipeline through which water was supplied to the engine froze. The crew was in danger of disaster, but the pilots in the air found a way out. How did they unfreeze the pipeline?
