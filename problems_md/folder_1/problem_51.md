# Problem 51. “Naked in winter”

For living beings, warm winter shoes are a natural phenomenon. Another surprising thing is that some animals and birds do not start anything for themselves before winter. Take a closer look at the pigeons, what are they wearing as they splash around in the snow? Of course, the skin on the paws is much thicker than on other parts of the body, and is also covered with scales. But such skin cannot save you from the cold. How do birds dressed so frivolously manage to safely endure harsh winters?
