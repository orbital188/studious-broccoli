# Problem 99. Guardians of the Gate 

There are many entrance holes in the anthill through which working individuals enter and exit. There is no way to seal them for a long time, and you canâ€™t make a gate either. What should you do to prevent someone else from slipping in? Set up security. Look, they will take her and carry her away. So what should we do?
