# Problem 55. “How a sparrow flies”

How do sparrows fly in a very strong wind, considering that this bird does not fly, but jumps along the trajectory of its flight? They cannot stay in flight for long, because the heart cannot stand it - it will “break.” An example of this weakness is very well known when China tried to get rid of sparrows that were eating their rice crops. The birds were not allowed to land for a long time, and the sparrows fell dead. The question is - how can she move in a strong wind that blows her away? Just don’t say that on foot, there’s already been a joke about that!
