# Problem 45. “Hull – in half”

Sometimes small things lead to serious accidents. For example, in the history of maritime disasters there is a curious case. The ship carrying peas received a small hole. Only one compartment of the hold was flooded, which did not pose a danger. However, this ship sank - the ship's hull was torn in half. And the reason for this was this small hole. Can you restore the situation and find out what happened and how?
