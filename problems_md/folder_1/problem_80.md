# Problem 80. “Axle and nut”

The situation at the Kanash plant. Cars are being repaired. When repairing a wheeled trolley, the nuts are placed on mastic so that they do not come loose when the car moves. And when the car comes for repairs, they cannot unscrew this nut. Traditional technology: Uncle Vasya takes a meter-long wrench, places it on the nut and hits the wrench with a hammer! Sooner or later the nut will give in, but how much sweat will come off Uncle Vasya! And how much time it takes! We purchased a machine for loosening nuts in France. Paid thousands of dollars! The latest technology: The machine twists the carriage axle, and the nut fits like a glove! What should I do?
