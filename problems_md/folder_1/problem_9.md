# Problem 9. “A fly for lunch”

Big fly for lunch. It is so beautiful! For a spider. However, spiders are small insects. Spiders differ from other arthropods in that their body is divided into two parts. The head is fused with the chest and, with the help of a thin part, is connected to the tummy. This part of the spider's body contains the lungs, liver, heart, ovaries and digestive tract. But the latter is very small, and the fly is big. I wonder how the spider eats a fly that would not fit inside the spider?
