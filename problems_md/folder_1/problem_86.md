# Problem 86. “Setting up “quietly””

Piano tuners are endowed not only with hearing from God, but also with angelic patience. For neighbors, this is many hours of torment. After all, they don’t have that kind of patience. The tuner makes each of the three strings that make up the “mode” sound at least three times – higher, lower and “exactly”. And there are many such strings. And there are a lot of sounds. It would be nice to set it up so as not to irritate the owners and neighbors. How to do this?
