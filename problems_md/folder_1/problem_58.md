# Problem 58. “Asphalt road without bitumen”

Asphalt consists mainly of sand and bitumen. Bitumen (similar to black tar) is one of the products that is obtained from petroleum. To build one kilometer of asphalt road, the amount of bitumen required is equal to that produced from 320 barrels of oil. Oil is expensive. And if you need to build, for example, 87 thousand kilometers of asphalt roads, the cost of bitumen will cost a pretty penny. Bitumen has another undesirable effect: this material is dangerous for the environment. How else can grains of sand be bonded together to get a cheap and an asphalt-like road surface that is safe for nature? Suggest a solution.
