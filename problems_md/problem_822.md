# Problem 1038. “Cheap delivery of bricks”

Coltharp calculated that the cost of delivering the building material along a difficult route, which ran through rugged and mountainous terrain, was 4 times higher than the cost of the bricks. And then the enterprising businessman came up with an idea that allowed him to reduce the cost of delivering the bricks to 7 cents per piece. What did Coltharp come up with?
