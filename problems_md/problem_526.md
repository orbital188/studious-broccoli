# Problem 657. “Territorial waters”

In the 16th century, sailing ships from different countries plied the seas and often sailed to foreign shores. Holland at that time was one of the most developed maritime powers. In order to regulate the movement of ships off its shores, the concept of “territorial waters” of a state began to be put into practice here for the first time. But how to determine the boundary of “territorial waters”, since there were no modern marine measuring instruments then?
