# Problem 588. “Cleaning the heat exchanger tubes”

To condense steam at thermal power plants, tubes are used through which water from natural reservoirs is driven. The tubes become dirty and clogged with sediment.  We decided to introduce elastic porous balls into the water. The water balls are pushed throughout the entire system and clean it. If the contamination is particularly high, use balls with an abrasive surface. But together with the dirt, the balls tear off the protective oxide film on their surface. The pipes begin to corrode. You can add corrosion inhibitors to water, but the water consumption is huge, you need a lot of inhibitor, and this is expensive. What to do? Source: Sat. RTEZ 1999, Ed. ChuvSU, s. 44.
