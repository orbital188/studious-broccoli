# Problem 1130. Caution! Minefield! 

For many years - and still - unexploded mines and shells that have remained in the ground since the Second World War and after other armed conflicts are found from time to time in different places. Detected ammunition is usually exploded in safe places. Sometimes it is known in advance that in a certain place at one time there was a fairly extensive mined area. For sappers, it is easier in such places to detonate the ammunition all at once right on the spot, taking people to a safe distance. It is known that old mines and shells can explode from any strong detonation. How to create it simultaneously over a vast territory?
