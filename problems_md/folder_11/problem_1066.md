# Problem 1066. “Older student”

In the late 1990s, a student who was already over 70 years old entered Tel Aviv University. After he studied for several years, the university decided to provide him with financial assistance and pay him a scholarship. According to the internal regulations of the university, this could only be done in strictly specified cases. What was the main justification for paying a scholarship to a 75-year-old student?
