# Problem 1053. “The Moneylender and the Merchant”

Tale. One merchant owed a moneylender a large sum of money and could not pay it back on time. The moneylender, knowing that the merchant had a beautiful daughter, offered to take her as his wife to pay off the debt. “But first you should find out what heaven thinks about this,” said the cunning moneylender. – I have two stones in my bag, black and white. If you pull out a white one, your debt is forgiven. If you pull out the black one, you’ll give me your daughter.” What should a merchant do to avoid giving his daughter to a moneylender?
