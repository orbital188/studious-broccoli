# Problem 1057. “Beat the drum!”

At the beginning of the 13th century. In northern China, the army of the Southern Song dynasty under the command of Bi Zaiyu met with the troops of the Jurchen state. The enemy was outnumbered, and Bi Zaiyu decided to retreat. To prevent the Jurchens from noticing this, the military commander ordered the camp to be abandoned, over which flags were flying and drums were constantly beating. When the Jurchens entered the camp a day later, not a single person was there, and the drumming continued to sound. How did Bi Zaiyu manage to arrange this?
