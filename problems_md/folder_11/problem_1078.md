# Problem 1078. “Eat or drink?”

In ancient times in the East, one despotic emir had a cruel custom. Those sentenced to execution were offered a choice: either receive any food and no drink at all times, or any drink and no food without restrictions. Usually, any choice led to a long and painful death. But one prisoner found a way out, thanks to which he was able to save his life. What did the prisoner choose?
