# Problem 1069. “Ancient Roman alcohol test”

In ancient Rome, a man was considered the head of the house. He “quite officially” could kick his wife out of the house if she cheated on him, made copies of keys to storage rooms, poisoned her children, or drank still-fermented wine. How did men belonging to the same house determine whether the woman living in their house drank wine or not?
