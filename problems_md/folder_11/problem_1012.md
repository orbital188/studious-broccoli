# Problem 1012. “Service”

Prince P.A. Zubov, who provided important services to Emperor Alexander during his accession, asked the sovereign to fulfill one request, without explaining what it was. The Emperor gave his word. Then Zubov presented to him for signature a pre-prepared pardon and definitive decree for Major General Arsenyev, who was convicted of hiding from his regiment during the battle. The emperor winced, but signed: “Receive service.” What should the king do? He kept his promise to save his honor. But how now to save the honor of the army?
