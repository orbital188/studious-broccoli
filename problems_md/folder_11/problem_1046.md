# Problem 1046. “Strategically important bridge”

In 1938, during the Third Reich in Germany, a large bridge was built across the Pregoli River on the Berlin-Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) autobahn near the village of Palmburg. For Germany preparing for war, it was an important strategic facility in the eastern direction. Therefore, the designers were given the task of providing the opportunity not only to connect the banks of the river, but also to easily separate them if necessary. How did the designers manage to do this?
