# Problem 1003. “Public apology”

The English playwright R. Sheridan, author of the famous “School of Scandal,” allowed himself to speak rather harshly about the activities of parliament in one of his plays. As punishment for this, he was forced to appear in parliament, kneel and make a public apology. Sheridan is forced to carry out this sentence. But he wanted to at least save face, and even better, “punish” parliament. What should he do?
