# Problem 1047. “Accident on a submarine”

In mid-1920, the new American 70-meter submarine S-5, commanded by Charles Cook, was conducting sea trials in the Atlantic Ocean. During an emergency dive, due to an oversight, the foreman did not close the valve of the ventilation line. Streams of water poured through it into the boat. Some of the compartments were completely flooded. The boat sank to the bottom, to a depth of 60 meters. There were no escape hatches on submarines of that time. The only way to save the crew is to send a signal buoy to the surface of the water. But the boat was underwater in a non-navigable part of the Atlantic, so the buoy might not have been noticed. Radio signals did not pass through the water column. And yet the captain managed to notify about the accident and save the crew. What did Charles Cook do?
