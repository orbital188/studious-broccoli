# Problem 1013. “Divine Grove”

The gods of the Babylonian kings lived in sacred groves. The king himself, as a living deity, also had to have such a grove in which he could wander, as befits the celestials. Planting such a grove is not difficult - the land around Babylon is surprisingly fertile. But the trouble is - the king is supposed to live in a high palace - his divine foot should not touch the sinful earth, he did not have the right to go down to the ground for walks. It is also forbidden to carry him on a stretcher through the grove - mortals, like porters, are not allowed into the sacred grove. What should the unfortunate godlike king do?
