# Problem 1089. Interactive symphonic overture 

P.I. Tchaikovsky wrote the program overture “1812” for performance in the open air by a large symphony orchestra. At the end of the work, according to the author’s idea, to mark the celebrations on the occasion of the victory of the Russian troops in the war, a bell ringing, a cannon salute, and the theme of the Russian anthem “God Save the Tsar” should sound. In the late 1990s, they decided to perform the “1812” overture on the famous Music Stage in Manchester (Great Britain). To enhance the effect, the directors involved the audience in the performance of the work, without disturbing the overall tone of the orchestra. How was this done?
