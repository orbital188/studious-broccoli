# Problem 1093. Bees and wasps 

Japanese honeybees carefully guard their nests from wasps. As soon as a guard bee detects an approaching wasp, 200-300 worker bees immediately rush out. After some time, the wasp falls dead. At the same time, none of the bees sting or even touch the wasp. How do honey bees kill their enemies?
