# Problem 1061. “What is the name of the violinist?”

In 1956, the famous American violinist Isaac Stern came to the USSR on tour. After the first concert, the musician spoke with journalists, and one of them asked a slightly tactless question: what is the correct spelling of his last name, Isaac Stern or Isaac Stern? What did the witty violinist, who knew the Russian language well enough, answer?
