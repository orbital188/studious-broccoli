# Problem 1067. First things first - airplanes!

The skin of the first all-metal aircraft TB-1 and TB-3, created in the late 1920s at the Tupolev Design Bureau, was made of corrugated duralumin. To increase the speed of aircraft, they were equipped with more powerful engines. This brought with it a new problem: the airframe had to be made more streamlined. It was not possible to immediately replace the aircraft's skin. In order not to interrupt the testing of new aircraft modifications, the design bureau found a temporary palliative solution. How did designers make corrugated aluminum more streamlined?
