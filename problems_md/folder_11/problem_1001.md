# Problem 1001. “Who has it better?”

Euripides always treated his work with the greatest responsibility. He once admitted: “I can write no more than three lines of poetry in a whole day.” And even then with great tension. Having learned about this, one insignificant Athenian poet was simply amazed: “So great!” Yes, I can write a whole hundred magnificent lines in a day! What do you advise me to answer to Euripides?
