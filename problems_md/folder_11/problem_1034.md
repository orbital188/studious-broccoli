# Problem 1034. “Cabbage without rot”

Alternaria blight, or black rot, is a common contagious disease of cabbage, asparagus, and other plants that are grown over large areas for food consumption. But black rot sometimes kills entire plantations. It is quite problematic to completely protect the crop without the use of pesticides. It is much easier and more environmentally friendly to promptly remove infected leaves so that viral bacteria do not spread further. But how to distinguish infected plants from uninfected ones?
