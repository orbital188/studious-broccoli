# Problem 1044. Typhoid as a cure for death 

During World War II, two Polish doctors worked in Nazi-occupied territory in a laboratory in the Jewish ghetto area. Doctors secretly discovered that if healthy people were given certain dead bacteria, they would test positive for typhus. The doctors decided to take advantage of this to save as many people as possible from hard labor in concentration camps. But if you inject the virus into the Jews in the ghetto, the Nazis will simply shoot them. Using cunning, Polish doctors managed to save more than 8,000 people. How did they do it?
