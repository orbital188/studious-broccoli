# Problem 1017. Mad Ajax

The ancient Greeks had a legend about Ajax. The hero, equal in valor to his friend Achilles, after his death wanted to receive Achilles' armor. However, the armor was awarded to Odysseus by the Achaeans. The offended Ajax decides to kill the Achaean leaders at night. Saving the Achaeans, Athena sends madness to Ajax. And instead of his opponents, he kills a herd of cattle. The ancient Greek artist Timomachus decided to paint a picture about the rage of Ajax. But the ancient canons forbade artists to depict strong feelings - it was believed that this would disfigure the picture (in Thebes there was even a death penalty for this). How to depict Ajax's madness?
