# Problem 1006. “Young men inexperienced in gambling”

Emperor Alexander I, upon ascending the throne, issued a decree “on the extermination of impermissible card games,” where, among other things, it was said that “a crowd of dishonest predators, having calmly considered the ruin of entire families, with one blow snatches the property of their ancestors from the hands of inexperienced young men, prepared for centuries of service and labor.” All those caught gambling were ordered to be taken into custody and sent to trial. The Emperor, having once met Levashev (one of these youths), said to him: “I heard that you play gambling?” I haven’t read the decree I gave against the players. How to answer Levashev? Yes, so as not to incur the royal wrath?
