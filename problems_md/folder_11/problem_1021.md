# Problem 1021. “Speak silently”

In Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion, the entire action is based on the fact that linguistics professor Higgins teaches the commoner Eliza to speak like an aristocrat. Both the plot and figurative elements of the play are connected with this. Imagine that you want to stage a ballet based on the play Pygmalion. But in ballet you can’t talk! What to base the plot on?
