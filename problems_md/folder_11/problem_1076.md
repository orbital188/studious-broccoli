# Problem 1076. “Is the dome level?”

In 1436, in Florence, Filippo Brunneleschi completed the construction of the dome of the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore. The cathedral itself began to be built on a marshy area back in 1296. It was built by different architects, so here and there there were errors in the relationship of parts. Thus, a huge dome with a diameter of 42 meters was built on a high rotunda with relatively thin walls. Architect Brunneleschi feared that over time the dome might become askew. Therefore, he initially provided the opportunity for any person, even an untrained specialist, to determine whether the dome was level. How did the architect do this?
