# Problem 392. “The squad of a noble citizen”

One noble citizen of Athens passionately wanted to become the master of Attica. But power in Athens will not be handed over to him just like that. You can, of course, seize power by force, but according to existing laws, no citizen has the right to have his own squad. And without a squad it is impossible to capture the Acropolis. (Whoever owns the Acropolis was the master not only of Athens, but of all of Attica). How to be a noble citizen?
