# Problem 302. “Imprinting in a scientific way”

Many animals, when born, remember the first object they saw. And then they follow him, feeling the most tender affection for him.  This phenomenon is called imprinting or imprinting. Usually the mother is imprinted in this way, but in a poultry farm, turkey poults emerging from eggs in an incubator imprint on each other or the farmer caring for them. This causes a lot of inconvenience and is even dangerous. When thousands of turkeys rush after one object, they crush each other and die. How to solve this problem?
