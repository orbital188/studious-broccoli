# Problem 353. “Wipe the nose of the customer or David?”

Soderini commissioned Michelangelo Buonarotti to sculpture David. The sculptor did a conscientious job, but the customer began to hesitate: the nose of the statue was too big... Michelangelo was faced with a choice: agree to the alteration and spoil the masterpiece, or refuse, but not receive a reward. Art is eternal, but I want to eat. What should I do?
