# Problem 329. “Plane without a queue”

At major US airports, planes fly to the desired city every half hour. For example, first your airline's plane departs, and thirty-five minutes later the competitor's plane departs, then yours, then the competitor's... Often, queues accumulate during check-in and when purchasing tickets - clients, saving their time, arrive at the airport almost before departure. If you don’t serve your customers quickly, they will fly away in half an hour on a competitor’s plane. What should your airline do?
