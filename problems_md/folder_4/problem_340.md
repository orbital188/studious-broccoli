# Problem 340. “Does a dead man need money?”

One French banker was greedy. Even after death. When he died, he left his heir a large sum of money, but in his will he demanded that 20 thousand pounds sterling be invested in his coffin. The money needs to be deposited - after all, this is written in the will, but the heir does not want to do this. Moreover, because of such a sum, lovers of easy money may open the grave. What should I do?
