# Problem 347. “Daughter’s Inheritance”

Lord Sempill died in England and a dispute arose over his property and hereditary title. The fact is that the Sempill family has a centuries-old tradition: the title of lord, castles and other property can only be inherited by a male offspring. The deceased's son claims the right to inherit. But Lord Sempill had a daughter 40 years ago, who also wants to inherit. What should she do?
