# Problem 319. Prince on a white horse

Every nation has its own wedding traditions. Delhi also has its own custom. The groom in national costume, having bowed to his parents, must go outside the threshold of his fatherâ€™s house and mount his horse. The groom must ride a horse to the bride's house. But galloping across the entire city may be romantic, but it takes too long and is also troublesome in the incredible flow of Delhi traffic. What should the groom do?
