# Problem 379. “Transfer of hot solution under pressure”

When carrying out chemical technological operations in reactor apparatus, there arises the need to transfer hot aqueous solutions in large volumes (up to 10-100 cubic meters) from one apparatus to another located at the same level. The aggressive properties of the solution do not allow their transfer by pumps of existing designs.  High temperature (85-95°C) excludes the possibility of transferring such a solution using vacuum in the receiving apparatus. Therefore, compressed air under a pressure of about 5 atm (500 kPa) is used for transmission, the excess of which, after completion of the transmission, is discharged into the atmosphere after it has been purified. At the same time, the processed and heated air contains a large concentration of harmful particles in the form of gases, vapors and aerosols, which can be very dangerous for the surrounding atmosphere. Purifying such air is very difficult and expensive (the cost of gas purification may exceed the cost of the main solution processing process). How to ensure the reduction or elimination of emissions from such a hot water solution with harmful substances during its transmission? Source: Sat. CRISIS - CNTI, 1992, p. 106.
