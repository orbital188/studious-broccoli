# Problem 354. Gretta Garbo's Ashes

The litigation over the urn containing Greta Garbo's ashes lasted for many years. The legendary movie star died in New York. The niece and heiress of actress Gray Reisfield intended to bury the urn in a special crypt. But the Swedes protested: after all, Greta Garbo was Swedish by birth, born in Stockholm. There she studied at the acting school. True, in 1925, at the age of 20, she moved to the United States, where she gained worldwide fame. However, the Swedish side believes that the ashes of the great Garbo should rest in their homeland. How to solve the problem?
