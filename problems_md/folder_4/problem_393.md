# Problem 393. “Bootleggers and Customs”

Bootlegger - there's so much in this word. America. Prohibition times. Bootlegging flourished - the importation of smuggled alcoholic beverages into the country and their trade. Liquor was delivered to America by sea, but the ships were often subject to customs inspection. If illegally transported goods were discovered, strict punishment followed. There is contraband goods on the ship, and the customs service ship will overtake the smugglers' ship in 5-10 minutes. How to be a bootlegger? You can, of course, drown the goods, but then you will suffer losses. Leaving the goods on the ship is guaranteed to incur severe punishment.
