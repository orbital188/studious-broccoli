# Problem 339. “Glass pipes in a trench”

At a chemical plant, it was necessary to lay a pipeline made of glass pipes between two workshops. They dug a trench, poured sand and began laying pipes. But due to very small unevenness of the bottom, the pipes began to break, especially when filling them with earth. It would be possible, of course, to level the bottom of the trench very precisely, but this would be time-consuming and expensive.
