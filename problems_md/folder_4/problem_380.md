# Problem 380. “Mask show in the shop”

Mask shows are a common thing in Russia, but not so much in Australia. One day, an Australian grocer in a small town, arriving at his store in the morning, found a pogrom there: ten policemen grabbed packages of eggs from the shelves and threw them on the floor. The grocer was told that the eggs had been confiscated and would be destroyed because they did not meet state standards. Undoubtedly, this was the work of the local egg mafia, which is thus trying to eliminate competitors. What to do? Resistance to the police is futile and dangerous. But is it possible to somehow reduce the damage and turn the harm into benefit?
