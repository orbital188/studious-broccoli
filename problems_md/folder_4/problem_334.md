# Problem 334. “Gas bubbles in protective varnish”

To protect the board with radio components from climatic influences, it is coated with varnish diluted with a highly volatile solvent.  When the varnish coating dries, microbubbles of gases and vapors are released from the board, which pierce the varnish film that has not yet dried. In places where the board is punctured, it is destroyed when used. To prevent such punctures, drying is carried out in a vacuum chamber, but this method is complicated and expensive. Suggest a more effective solution.
