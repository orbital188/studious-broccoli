# Problem 398. “Stamp with an error”

In 1962, the US Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating the anniversary of the death of UN Secretary General Dag Hammorskjöld, who died in a plane crash. In a small part of the circulation, the yellow background of the stamp turned out to be upside down. These stamps fell into the hands of Leonard Herman, who was going to make good money from this. How did the postal administration prevent his plans?
