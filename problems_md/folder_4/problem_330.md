# Problem 330. Pigs of the Papuans

The Papuan tribes living in New Guinea honor the cult of the pig. They are raised in the house as members of the family: they are addressed by name, talk to them, stroke them, and feed them the best dishes from the family table. In some Papuan tribes, women even breastfed piglets. When the pig grows up, it is inevitably killed - this is what religion dictates. But none of the family members has the right to kill, much less eat the meat of a family member. And I want to eat. What should I do?
