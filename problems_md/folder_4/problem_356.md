# Problem 356. “The coal bites”

The year was 1898. The young entrepreneur and mine owner Hugo Stinnes could not sell coal on his own. Like all members of the coal syndicate, he was contractually obligated to sell it through the syndicate. If Stinnes had sold coal on his own at prices not agreed upon with the coal syndicate, his mine would soon have gone bankrupt as a result of the syndicate's actions. But it is better to trade coal yourself - this gives advantages to the mine owner. What should Stinnes do?
