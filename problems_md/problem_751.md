# Problem 944. “Destroying Woodpecker”

Residents of the small town of Sullivan, New York (USA), found themselves in a zone of disaster and destruction brought by... a simple woodpecker. The bird that has settled here mercilessly destroys car mirrors. Auto repair shop owner Tim Taylor replaced 30 mirrors at the beginning of summer last year and already has 18 this year. “I tried to drive him away by shouting “ksh-ksh!” – says Pontiac owner Anna Miller. “He flew off, but then came back, broke the driver’s side mirror, walked importantly along the hood past the windshield and broke the passenger’s side mirror.” Explain why the woodpecker hits mirrors?
