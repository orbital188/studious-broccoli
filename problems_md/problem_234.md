# Problem 297. “Noise of the electro-hydraulic shock installation”

When processing parts on an electro-hydraulic shock installation, a very loud howl is heard. It is produced by a barrel filled with water into which the part being processed is placed. Electrodes are lowered there and then an electrical discharge is produced. To make the noise (howling) less, you need to close the barrel with a lid before turning on the current. But the lid is heavy, working with it slows down the process and significantly reduces the productivity of the installation. Therefore, the lid is most often not closed. How to solve the problem without reducing the performance of the installation?
