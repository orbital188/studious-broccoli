# Problem 208. “Scuba divers”

There are many methods of fighting against military courts. There are enough weapons on the ships. But often having an excellent weapon is not enough - you also need to be able to defend yourself from combat scuba divers. Until recently, nets were placed next to the ship and their soldiers were lowered into the water... This is exactly how M. Gorbachev and R. Reagan were guarded during negotiations in Malta. How else can a warship protect itself from sabotage by scuba divers?
