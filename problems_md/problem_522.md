# Problem 653. “Gas purification from phosphoric acid”

During the production of acid from phosphorus-containing sludge, a fog of tiny droplets of phosphoric acid is often formed. It is captured using electrostatic filters, which are effective (the degree of purification is 99.8%), but expensive. How can this fog of phosphoric acid droplets not form? Source: Coll.
