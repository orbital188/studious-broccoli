# Problem 1306. “Smelling treat for a raccoon”

The banana slug, common in the forests of the Pacific coast of North America, grows up to 25 centimeters in length. In addition, it is bright yellow in color, making it easy for raccoons to find. For raccoons, a thick, fat slug is a good treat. One problem: the body of the banana slug is covered with a thick viscous mass, which acts on the raccoon as an anesthetic, that is, it temporarily kills all nerve receptors. But the raccoon learned to “clean” the slug. How does this raccoon do it?
