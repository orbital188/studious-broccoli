# Problem 516. “Is the sky above the boiler room clear”

Smoke is a mirror of the process of fuel combustion in the boiler furnace. If there is a light, transparent haze above the high chimney, then everything is in order. Plumes of black smoke indicate trouble - these are particles of unburned fuel flying out of the boiler firebox. Of course, you can periodically go out and raise your head to the sky and see what color the smoke is pouring out of the chimney. But it is advisable to know about this at the operator’s workplace. It would be nice if the smoke “itself” signaled to the operator about the presence of unburned fuel particles. How can I do that?
