# Problem 532. “Divide and conquer!”

Caliph Hakim loved, dressed in the dress of a commoner, to wander around Cairo at night. Once, during one of these walks, he met ten armed men who, recognizing the Caliph, began to ask him for money. The hour was late, the place was deserted, their requests threatened to develop into demands. It is unknown what fate would have befallen Hakim then. But the Caliph was first and foremost a politician, and this saved him. What did he do to save himself? Offer your options.
