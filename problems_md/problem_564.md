# Problem 715. Heavy Mace

The mace in Ancient Rus' is one of the types of weapons. It was a massive wooden club, thickened at the “combat” end. Often inside this thickening - to increase the impact force - there was a stone. How did ancient Russian fighters manage to “insert” a stone inside the mace?
