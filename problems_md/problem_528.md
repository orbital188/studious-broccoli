# Problem 659. “Leak in the samovar”

One factory received an order for a large batch of souvenir samovars. The samovar is small - only 0.4 liters in volume, but everything else is like a real one. To check if there were leaks somewhere in the samovars, inspectors poured water and looked for droplets. But the samovar is small, and the leaking droplets are hard to see. How to get out of this situation?
