# Problem 1135. Halibut: 1 piece 

Once in the 1980s, English fishermen caught a huge halibut - a large flounder weighing about 100 kg. The fish were unloaded from the trawler into the bathroom and decided to be transported to a processing plant, which was several hours away by car. But during this time, halibut without water can simply spoil, and the fishermen, naturally, did not have a huge “mobile aquarium”. And yet the huge fish was delivered to the factory fresh and even alive. How did the fishermen do it?
