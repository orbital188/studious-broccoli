# Problem 675. “Cleaning flue gases from thermal power plants”

It is very important to protect the environment from sulfur dioxide contained in the flue gases of coal-fired thermal power plants and thermal power plants. To purify these gases, they are passed through a solution of lime (Ca(OH)2). In this case, the acidic oxide is absorbed by the alkaline solution. However, the volumes of purified gases are very large, the cost of such purification turns out to be unacceptably high and a lot of reagent (slaked lime) is consumed. What to do? Source: Sat.
