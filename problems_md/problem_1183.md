# Problem 1427. Smart candles 

The ancient Greeks measured time at night by candles - a candle of a certain size burned for a certain time. The Greeks also had special large candles, which, with the help of a small improvement, loudly reminded the owners that the measured period of time had passed. How did the candles notify their owners of this?
