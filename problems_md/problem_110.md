# Problem 142. “Production of aluminum bromide”

To obtain aluminum bromide, bromine vapor is passed through a column with aluminum shavings at a temperature of 500-600°C. Its boiling point = 256°C, i.e. this is salt vapor: 2 Al + 3 Br2 =(t)=> 2 AlBr3 + 412 kJ/mol (exothermic reaction). The vapor product evaporates and is collected in the condenser (refrigerator) in the form of a white powder. To increase the productivity of this column, they tried to increase the supply of bromine steam.  At the same time, heat was released above the permissible level, the aluminum melted (Tm = 660°C).  In addition, it turned out that at elevated temperatures an admixture of monobromoaluminum AlBr is formed, which, when cooled, decomposes to release the metal: 3 AlBr = (cold) => AlBr3 + 2 Al. As a result, the product turned out to be contaminated with aluminum (it acquired a gray color). How to increase the productivity of the column and not degrade the quality of the target product?
