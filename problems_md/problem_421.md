# Problem 544. Resourceful soldier 

The general waddles along the bridge, looks around with a lazy gaze - and then a soldier caught his eye. The soldier is AWOL and wants to rush past, pretending not to notice the general. General: “Soldier, what is this?!” Why didn’t they salute?!” The soldier answered in such a way that the general was confused, saluted and immediately headed home. What did the soldier say?
