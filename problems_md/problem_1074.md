# Problem 1314. “Polar bear hunt”

Seal oil is a delicacy for the polar bear. Therefore, the Eskimos used it to hunt these animals. The Eskimos coated whalebone with seal oil and left such bait in a place where the animal might be. The bear ate the bait, and the whalebone tore open its stomach from the inside. But how did the Eskimos disguise food that was lethal to the bear?
