# Problem 793. “Fake painting”

An Austrian museum decided to buy a painting by a famous artist in France. A group of French and Austrian experts examined the painting and were convinced that it was genuine; in their presence, the notary put a stamp on the back of the canvas certifying its authenticity. When the painting was delivered to Austria, one glance at the canvas was enough to see: the painting was a fake, although the print was in place. How did scammers bypass experts? Source(s): G.
