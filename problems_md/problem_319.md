# Problem 399. “Dirty and clean air”

Exhaust gases from excavators and dump trucks accumulate in quarries.  There is a known method of ventilating quarries, in which dirty air is heated so that it becomes lighter and rises. However, heated air mixes with cold air, and this reduces the effectiveness of ventilation. How, while maintaining the previous method, can we reduce the mixing of hot dirty and clean cold air?
