# Problem 1386. Halt in the swamp

19th century. A platoon of soldiers of the French Foreign Legion in Algeria, making a long forced march, ended up in a swampy area. For tens of kilometers around there is not a single dry piece of land, not a tree, not a bush, not a dry hummock. A solid muddy mess underfoot. The soldiers walked without rest for many hours. It became necessary to take a break. But underfoot there is only swamp mud and mud, and there is nothing to put down to even sit on. How did the soldiers manage to sit down and rest their legs?
