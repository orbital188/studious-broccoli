# Problem 1313. “There is no way for the steamer”

There is a whole group of small sea and river living organisms that lead a “sedentary lifestyle” under water. Biologists call them “foulers” because, with the help of their suction cups, they are attached to various hard surfaces, including the underwater part of sea vessels. And this greatly reduces the speed of the vessel, increases resistance when moving, and hence fuel consumption. How to rid a ship's hull of fouling agents?
