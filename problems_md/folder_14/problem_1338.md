# Problem 1338. History of air 

Meteorologists note global climate change on Earth. It also affects air quality. Modern equipment is capable of quite accurately determining fluctuations in its chemical composition. However, scientists began to conduct such studies relatively recently. To determine how much air quality has changed over several centuries, you need to have air “samples” from two or three centuries ago. But where can you get them today?
