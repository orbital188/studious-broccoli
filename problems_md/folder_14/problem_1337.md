# Problem 1337. “Acupuncture exam”

Acupuncture (acupuncture) was practiced in ancient China before our era. The main thing in this practice is to accurately determine the place on the human body where the needle needs to be placed to treat the disease. Future doctors in Ancient China, after studying the theory, passed a practical exam. It was necessary to stick needles into a statue in the form of a life-size human figure. But how did the examiners determine that the needles were inserted correctly - in exactly the right places?
