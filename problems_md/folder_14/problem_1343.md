# Problem 1343. “Naval deception”

During the First World War, radar had not yet been invented. During naval battles, visual rangefinders were used to determine the type, size, speed and direction of movement of the ship. The outcome of armed conflicts at sea often depended on the accuracy of these parameters. British naval sailors have found a way to confuse enemy visual rangefinders, thereby gaining time for maneuvers. How did British ships deceive those watching them?
