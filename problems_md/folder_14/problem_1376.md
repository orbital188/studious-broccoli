# Problem 1376. Fair bears 

In the 17th century In the Belarusian town of Smorgon there was an “educational institution” for training bears. Bear cubs caught in local forests were brought here, in batches of 5-6 individuals, over a couple of months they were taught to dance to a tambourine on their hind legs and, accompanied by a guide, they were sent for the season - until the bears hibernated - to work at fairs in Europe. How to make six bears rise on their hind legs at the same time? How to teach them to dance to the beat of a tambourine?
