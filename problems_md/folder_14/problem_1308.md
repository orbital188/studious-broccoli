# Problem 1308. “The circulation of worms in stomachs”

The life of a parasitic worm called a dog tapeworm is divided into several stages. Its microscopic larvae “live” in the grass. Sheep eat this grass along with the larvae. The larvae enter her brain through the stomach with the blood and develop there. But in order to “grow up” and begin to reproduce, the larvae must enter the wolf’s stomach. That is, the wolf must kill exactly the sheep in which the worm has settled - otherwise the life cycle of the tapeworm will be disrupted. How does a tapeworm cause a sheep to become prey for a wolf?
