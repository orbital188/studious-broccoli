# Problem 1357. “Analyses collect bedbugs”

The Iberian lynx living in Spain is listed in the Red Book as an endangered species of animals. Biologists carefully monitor the preservation and increase of their population. To perform a pregnancy test on female bobcats, they are captured, euthanized, have their blood drawn for testing, and are released again. The process is expensive and time-consuming. “Why not use a “natural resource” – blood-sucking bugs – to collect blood from lynxes?” – the scientists thought. But how to do this?
