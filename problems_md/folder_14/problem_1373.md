# Problem 1373. Grandmother's notations 

Queen Victoria of Great Britain was distinguished by her strict morals, the observance of which she also demanded from her loved ones. One day she received a letter from her grandson, the future King George V. The boy asked to send him some pocket money. The prim grandmother, in her response letter, burst out with moral lectures on the topic that a true gentleman should not ask for money, it is not good and dishonest. Having received a letter with grandmotherâ€™s moralizing instead of the expected money, the future King George V still found a way to get the desired amount. How did he do this?
