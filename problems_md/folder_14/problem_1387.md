# Problem 1387. “The houses are rocking”

Modern buildings sometimes have more than a hundred floors. At an altitude of several hundred meters, these structures sway noticeably when exposed to wind. Even taking into account the safety margin of building materials, this may be unsafe for the building. In addition, people inside on the upper floors may experience significant discomfort. How can one, if not eliminate, then at least reduce the amplitude of the sway of a skyscraper?
