# Problem 1346. Rowdy on the bus 

City shuttle bus, half filled with passengers. The driver sees in the mirror how a fairly drunk man appears at a bus stop and begins to gradually “annoy” those around him with his behavior: pesters him with questions, shouts loudly, even sings. This goes on for several stops. Passengers react nervously, try to remain calm, but it is noticeable that the “resolution” will soon come. And then the driver makes an announcement over the speakerphone in the cabin, after which the rowdy calmly gets off at the next stop, and the bus continues moving. How did the driver manage to convince the drunk man to leave the car?
