# Problem 1377. Attention! Gases! 

The operation of a car engine is invariably accompanied by the release of exhaust gases after fuel combustion. Exhaust gases are discharged outside through a special pipe. As a rule, at the initial stage, when the car is just starting, a little more fuel enters the combustion chamber, which means more exhaust gases are released from the pipe. How can this resource be used to create a device against car thieves?
