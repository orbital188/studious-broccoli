# Problem 1324. “Goats without a leader”

Once a new group of animals was brought to the Talin Zoo - zebras, monkeys, lions. They were placed in cages and enclosures. All the animals accepted the new conditions normally, and only the mountain goats behaved restlessly - they were constantly nervous, bleating, running around the enclosure, butting each other, trying to figure out who was “most important.” Such fuss in the enclosure caused inconvenience not only to visitors, but also to nearby animals. Zoo workers decided to help the mountain goats identify the leader. The herd immediately calmed down. How did you manage to prioritize among the mountain goats?
