# Problem 1340. “The upper room is full of people”

From the memoirs of Soviet dissident Anatoly Marchenko. Late 1960s. Siberia. Transfer at the stage of convoying prisoners. Forty prisoners were taken out of the railway cars to be taken by car to the place where they were serving their sentences. There is only one car. There are no additional flights allowed. But the body of a flatbed cargo truck cannot accommodate forty people, even if people just stand, pressed closely against each other. How did the guards manage to solve the problem of “loading” prisoners into the back of a car?
