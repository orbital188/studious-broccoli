# Problem 1301. “What are the rewards for?”

During the Second World War, Soviet soldiers and officers were awarded medals for exploits accomplished in battles for the capitals of foreign states - Budapest, Prague, Berlin, etc. From a military point of view, battles are equally difficult in any city. But the Soviet political leadership, even in the award lists, wanted to emphasize that among these states there are “ours” and “not ours.” How was this done?
