# Problem 1400. Fast basketball 

According to basketball rules, if the game ends with the same score, extra time is assigned. During a match in the European basketball tournament between the teams of Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, when there were only 8 seconds left in the game, the difference in the score was 2 points in favor of the Bulgarians. But to reach the next stage, the Bulgarian team needed a 5-point gap in the score. The Bulgarian coach understood that during this time it would not be possible to gain the necessary advantage. At the decisive moment, he asked for a short break and gave instructions to the players, following which the team managed to get the desired 5 points. How did the Bulgarian team manage to do this?
