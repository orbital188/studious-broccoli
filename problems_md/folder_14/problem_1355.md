# Problem 1355. “Unloading public transport”

On a weekday from 6 to 8 am, city public transport is usually crowded: people are rushing to work. Often in this crowd there are also representatives of that category of citizens who do not particularly need to rush at this time - pensioners, the unemployed, etc. How to “force” them to use public transport at other times?
