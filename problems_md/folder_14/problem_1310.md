# Problem 1310. “Open mouth of a moray eel”

The moray eel has small gills relative to its head, so it must constantly keep its mouth open to pump water and provide sufficient oxygen. But the moray eel has a large mouth. A constantly open mouth can scare off prey during hunting. How does a moray eel disguise its huge open mouth?
