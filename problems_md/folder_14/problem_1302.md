# Problem 1302. Children's holiday on Ivan Kupala

The ancestors of the Eastern Slavs celebrated the holiday of Ivan Kupala on the day of the summer solstice. One of the main attributes of the holiday was jumping over fire. It was believed that whoever jumped over the fire on Ivan Kupala would protect himself from damage for a whole year. At the same time, the parents of small children wanted to cleanse them from the evil eye. But you canâ€™t force a child who has just learned to walk to jump over fire! And it was necessary to observe the ritual according to the rules of that time. What analogue of fire, over which small children could jump, did the ancestors of the Eastern Slavs choose for them?
