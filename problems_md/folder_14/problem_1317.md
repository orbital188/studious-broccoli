# Problem 1317. “Penguins’ paws don’t get cold”

Penguins living in Antarctica are saved from the cold by a thick layer of fat and a dense three-layer “cushion” of feathers. Birds' body temperature is 40 degrees. But penguins' paws are not protected by either fat or fur. Penguins can stand in the snow for a long time. The blood in the paws circulates normally, and its temperature is only a couple of degrees above freezing. This temperature in the paws is needed so that they do not freeze. How do penguins manage to safely maintain a large difference in blood temperature between their paws and the rest of their body?
