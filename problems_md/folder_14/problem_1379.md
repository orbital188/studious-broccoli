# Problem 1379. “Ball in the hole”

Gophers dig deep, branched burrows. One of these minks quietly appeared on a country tennis court. One day, during a game, a tennis ball landed right in a gopher's hole. There was no other ball. But getting the ball that had disappeared into the hole was problematic. And yet one of the players managed to do it without tearing up the ground. How did he do this?
