# Problem 1375. “Bulls in the vanguard of the offensive”

Ancient China. There is a war between the troops of the Yan Dynasty and the Qi Dynasty. The Qis army besieged the city for a long time. The besieged under the command of Tian Dan decided to break through. The sortie was planned for the night, when the Qi soldiers would be asleep. In order to immediately sow panic in the ranks of the besiegers, it was decided to first release the bulls, which were collected from all over the city, through the city gates. The bulls were dressed in purple blankets embroidered with images of dragons, and sharp swords were tied to their horns. But how to make bulls run towards the enemy?
