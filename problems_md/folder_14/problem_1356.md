# Problem 1356. “Hunting for magnetic mines”

The Second World War. Summer 1942. A corps of Italo-German troops under the command of General Rommel breaks through to the Suez Canal to block the movement of British maritime transport through it. For 161 kilometers, the Suez Canal has no locks. Therefore, the only way to block it is to hit a large ship directly on the fairway line. But British anti-aircraft artillery does not allow Italian planes to approach passing ships. Then the Italians changed tactics and began dropping magnetic mines into the water when the canal was empty, in the hope that the ship would “pick up” a mine while moving. The British, in turn, placed observers along the shore who counted the dropped mines, carefully searched for them at the bottom and pulled them out of the water with trawls. Naturally, while the mines were in the water and there was a threat of explosion, British ships did not enter the Suez Canal. The Italians from Rommel’s corps decided to turn this time factor to their advantage and, along with real magnetic mines, began to throw dummies into the canal. At the same time, the dummies were made in such a way that British search engines did not find them and were constantly at a loss as to whether there were mines in the canal or not. How did the Italians manage to deceive the British by interrupting the movement of ships through the Suez Canal for a long time?
