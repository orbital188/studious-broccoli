# Problem 1320. “Difficult choice”

Situation. On a rainy, stormy night, a man is driving along a country highway in a car with only one empty seat. At the bus stop he sees three people. This is a good friend of his, who once provided the man with an invaluable service, and now is the time to return the favor. Nearby is a charming woman whom the driver had previously only seen from afar and whom he had long dreamed of meeting. And on the bench is an old man who is clearly unwell and simply needs to be urgently taken to the hospital.  The man stops the car and makes a decision, after which all his moral and ethical problems have been satisfied. What did the driver do?
