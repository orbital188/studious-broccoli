# Problem 1345. “Sunken porcelain”

From the beginning of the 19th century. On the seabed off the coast of one of the Japanese islands there was a sunken ship, on board of which were ancient imperial vases made of precious Korean porcelain. Local residents knew about this, but even the famous Japanese deep-sea divers, ama, could not reach them. One of the fishermen realized that it was possible to raise valuable porcelain with the help of sea creatures. How did a fisherman manage to recover porcelain vases from a sunken ship?
