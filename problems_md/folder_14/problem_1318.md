# Problem 1318. Silent crickets 

One small yellow fly in the forests of North America lays its larvae only on crickets, finding them by chirping. At the same time, the crickets that have become carriers of the larvae stop making sounds. Among the crickets, only males chirp, thereby attracting females. Therefore, in the 1990s in the Hawaiian Islands, as a result of the massive proliferation of yellow flies, most crickets lost the ability to chirp. However, the “non-chirping” male crickets managed to find females in the forests to procreate. How did the crickets do it?
