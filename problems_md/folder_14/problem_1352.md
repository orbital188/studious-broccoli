# Problem 1352. “Successful siege”

In the 13th century n. e. Genghis Khan's troops besieged the city of Ning-xia, the capital of the Tangut state in Tibet. The siege was difficult and long. Thinking about lifting the siege, Genghis Khan gathered his commanders. One of them remembered that Ning-xia was famous for its abundance of domestic animals and birds. Then Genghis Khan sent envoys to the besieged city, who reported that the siege would be lifted if the townspeople “bought off” their pets. The residents of Ning-xia agreed. However, after they handed over the ransom, they had to surrender the city. What did Genghis Khan do?
