# Problem 1327. “We urgently need to grow up”

A journalist from a state television channel needs to conduct a “positive” interview with a government official. The journalist is tall, but the interviewee is not tall enough. Next to a journalist in the frame, a representative of the government will clearly be in a losing position, and this can damage the image of a public figure. How can one, if not “elevate,” then at least “equalize” two interview participants for the audience’s perception?
