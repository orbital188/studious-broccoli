# Problem 1374. “Coffee in bed or in a cup?”

People with disabilities experience many inconveniences in everyday life that others are not even aware of. For example, for those who have vision problems, it can be difficult to even pour themselves a drink - you cannot see the level of liquid in the cup. It’s good if it’s juice and if it’s too much it just spills onto the table. What if it's hot tea or coffee? You might get scalded. How can you help the visually impaired in such a situation?
