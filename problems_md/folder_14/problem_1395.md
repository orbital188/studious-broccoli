With this woman, they used the services of the same tailor, so the actress knew what dress the woman was going to wear for her anniversary. Naturally, Orlova did not want to see her husband’s mistress at the holiday and made it so that, as soon as she appeared, the woman immediately ran away. How did Lyubov Orlova manage to do this?
