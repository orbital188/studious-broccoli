# Problem 1399. “Failed wedding”

The young man and the girl decided to get married. The bride's parents spent $35,000 on wedding preparations - a restaurant, cars, travel. But five days before the painting, the groom “ran away.” The wedding has been cancelled, but the money can no longer be returned. And yet, the would-be bride managed to get significant capital from the funds invested in the event, which attracted the attention of many other potential suitors for her hand and heart. How did she do this?
