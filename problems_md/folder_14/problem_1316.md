# Problem 1316. “How to get rid of grass”

Summer has passed, and after the dacha season, a huge pile of grass and bushes from various vegetable crops (cucumbers, tomatoes, eggplants, etc.) has formed in the garden. Disposal of grass and bushes requires a lot of effort and time and is currently carried out in the following ways:1 . Chopping with an ax, collecting in garbage bags and throwing in the trash.2. Drying the grass and burning it in a special barrel, then the ash is scattered as fertilizer.3. Digging holes, dumping and burying (for further rotting). Please note that all the methods used now require a lot of effort and time. Question: how to get rid of grass and bushes with less effort and time. (Giving up growing vegetables is not an option.)
