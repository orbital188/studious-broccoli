# Problem 1385. “Winter Hunt”

In winter, foxes hunt mice and other small rodents, which sometimes also emerge from their burrows from under the snow in search of food. Noticing the mouse, the fox quietly creeps closer. But mice are very shy. At the slightest danger, they hide in the hole again. The snow creaking under the fox's paws will clearly frighten the mouse. How can a fox silently sneak up on its prey in the snow?
