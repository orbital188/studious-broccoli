# Problem 1307. “Take care of your nose from a young age”

When bottlenose dolphins, or bottlenose dolphins, that live off the coast of Australia fail to catch prey in the ocean, they sink to the bottom to find flounder, stingrays and other small bottom-dwelling fish. But bottom-dwelling fish most often bury themselves in the sand. To find them, dolphins have to literally “dig the ground with their noses.” This is not always safe: there may be sharp stones at the bottom. How can bottlenose dolphins protect their noses while hunting bottom fish?
