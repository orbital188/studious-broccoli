# Problem 1349. “The Insulted Duchess”

In medieval Germany, the nobility highly and demonstratively valued their class dignity. According to legend, once a noble duke held a costume ball in his majestic castle on the Rhine. All evening his wife, the Duchess, danced with a charming man who hid his face under a mask. In the end, the duchess wanted to find out who this polite stranger was, and as a hostess, she ordered him to take off his mask. Under the mask was a man from the duke's servants. For the noble duke, the fact that his wife spent the evening with a commoner in public was a fatal blow to his honor and dignity. It was necessary to urgently do something to avoid the sudden threat of insult. How did the Duke manage to do this?
