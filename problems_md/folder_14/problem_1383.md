# Problem 1383. “Air for testing”

During a physics lesson, the teacher decided to demonstrate to the students how the level of air pollution is determined. For greater clarity, it was decided to take the air from the part of the city where large industrial enterprises were located. The teacher handed one of the students an empty jar with a lid and told him to go to an industrial area and bring air from there for an experiment. But the jar already contained the air of the school. How can a student fill the jar with air in the desired area?
