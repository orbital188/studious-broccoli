# Problem 1319. “The criminal became a gladiator”

Once the wife of the ancient Roman emperor Gallienus complained to her all-powerful husband that a merchant had sold her fake jewelry. The enraged Gallienus ordered the merchant to be seized and publicly punished so that others would be discouraged. During the gladiatorial fights, which all of Rome gathered to watch, a merchant with one sword was released into the arena to fight a fair duel with a wild animal. More often than not, the criminal died. But the merchant remained alive after the battle and was released. At the same time, the name of the merchant and his shameful act were remembered for a long time by all the inhabitants of Rome. How did Gallienus achieve this?
