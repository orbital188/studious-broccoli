# Problem 1362. Bearing disassembly 

The bearing consists of two tightly combined wide metal rings, inside which steel balls or rollers move freely. This prefabricated unit is used in many mechanisms. There are times when a bearing needs to be disassembled without breaking the outer ring. But how to do this, since the metal ring holds the balls inside very tightly?
