# Problem 1382. “Caution – glass!”

Reducing costs is one of the main ongoing tasks of efficient production. At one time, the management of the Renault automobile company, having analyzed the situation at their factories, drew attention to the fact that about 3 percent of windshields arrived from the manufacturing plant to the car assembly site broken. We found out that the main reason is that the movers, despite the warning signs on the packaging containers, handle the glass rather carelessly. Renault engineers have proposed a simple way to force movers to be more careful when handling expensive car glass. After the implementation of this proposal, glass breakage decreased significantly. How was this achieved?
