# Problem 1304. “Fish in the grip of a snake”

In Australia, Indonesia and Indochina, the large Arafura warty snake lives - up to 2 meters. She lives in bodies of water and feeds exclusively on fish. The snake lies motionless on the bottom for a long time, waiting for a fish proportional to the size of the snake to swim past. Then the snake grabs the fish with its whipping tail, wraps itself around it and squeezes until it is completely suffocated. But in the water the fish is slippery and can jump out of the trap. How does the Arafura snake manage to retain its caught prey?
