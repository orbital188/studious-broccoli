# Problem 1339. Slow elevator

One private construction company commissioned a multi-storey residential building. We signed the acceptance certificate. Handed over to the management company. But soon the owners began to receive complaints from residents - and more than one! - the fact that the elevator in the house moves very slowly. What to do? Install a new elevator? Expensive. Ignore complaints? Reputation will suffer. And residents can refuse to pay for a “slow” elevator. The management company turned to a consultant. Having understood the situation, he proposed a simple and economical way to “calm down” the elevator passengers. What advice would you give to the management company?
