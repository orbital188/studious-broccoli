# Problem 369. Fire on the Island

A man is on an island. Due to the long drought, the grass and bushes on the island have become very dry. Suddenly, a fire broke out at one end of the island, and the wind drove the fire towards the man. A man cannot escape in the sea, since many sharks swim in the sea near the shore. There are no shores without vegetation on the island. How can a person be saved? Source: Creative association “Flight of Thought” (Chelyabinsk)
