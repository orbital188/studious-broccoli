# Problem 736. “Spy in a boat”

In 1893, German spy Ludwig Windel was given the task of infiltrating the French naval base in Toulon. The easiest way to do this was by boat from the sea. The spy approached the restricted area, but then a guard ordered him to stop and not to go any further. Windel obeyed. And yet he managed to infiltrate the naval base. How did he do it?
