# Problem 610. The Disobedient Knot

The Old Scientist Cat spent his entire life looking for new medicines. He tested many herbs, and he couldn’t count how many bottles he broke! One day they sent the Scientist Cat a bag of rare roots from a mountainous country. The bag is stuffed to the top and tied tightly. And the fabric is very dense - mice cannot chew through it. The cat tried to untie the bag - all in vain. I just broke off my claws in vain. This is what happens when you can’t find a knife or scissors in the house. What should the Scientist Cat do? Tell!
