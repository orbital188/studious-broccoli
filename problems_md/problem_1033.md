# Problem 1269. Improbable golf 

In 2007, the American company Electronic Arts released another version of the computer golf game. The game was called Tiger Woods PGA - after the famous American golfer Eldrick Woods, nicknamed “Tiger”. Very soon, the company began to receive numerous email complaints from gamers about an “impossible” and “implausible” episode in the game: hitting a ball lying on the surface of a pond. The company needed to save its professional reputation among fans of the game, who were not satisfied with the routine replies from the mail robot and were actively discussing the “flaw” of Electronic Arts. How did the developers of the computer game manage to “calm down” the indignant gamers? In 2007, the American company Electronic Arts released another version of the computer game golf.
