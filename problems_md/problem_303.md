# Problem 381. Crossing the river 

A father and two sons went on a hike. On their way they met a river, near the bank of which there was a raft. It can support either a father or two sons on the water. How can father and sons cross to the other side? Source: Creative association “Flight of Thought” (Chelyabinsk)
