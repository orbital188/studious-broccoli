# Problem 409. Aviation patrol

One of the types of aviation combat operations is to cover one’s advancing troops from possible enemy bombing. Fighters cover the troops, flying at low altitude and low speed, so as not to waste a lot of fuel. But when the enemy appears, they find themselves in a very disadvantageous position: they do not have a headroom and high speed, which is very important for the success of the battle. But you can’t patrol at high altitude: you might not have time to cover the troops. What to do? Source: Creative association “Flight of Thought” (Chelyabinsk)
