# Problem 1256. Search pigs 

Thanks to their keen sense of smell, dogs are widely used for various search work - following a person’s scent, determining the presence of narcotic and explosive substances. Dogs are also used to collect valuable underground mushrooms - truffles. It is necessary to train a dog to “truffle” from a very early age. It's long and expensive. It turned out that it is much more effective to use pigs for this purpose. It is believed that pigs are less trainable than dogs. Why are pigs used more often than dogs to find truffles?
