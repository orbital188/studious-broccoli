# Problem 848. “Football in Polynesia”

Tuvalu is an island nation in Polynesia located on the Funafuti Atoll. The land area is only 26 sq. km.  Communication with the “mainland” - ships by water and planes by air. The state is home to about 13,000 people. At the same time, Tuvalu has its own national football team, which participates in the World Cup and the Olympic Games. However, due to the limited territory on the island, it is not possible to build a full-fledged football stadium. How did the islanders get out of this situation?
