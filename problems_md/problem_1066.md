# Problem 1305. “Clowns are not afraid of sea anemones”

Amphiprion fish are found around marine coral reefs. Their bright colors earned them the nickname “clown fish.” Amphiprions hide from their enemies, predatory fish, between the tentacles of sea anemones and invertebrate coral polyps. Poisonous tentacles can paralyze passing fish with one touch, which the sea anemone then swallows with its huge mouth. But sea anemones do not bother clownfish. How do amphiprions manage to painlessly endure the touch of the tentacles of a poisonous sea anemone?
