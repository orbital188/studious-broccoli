# Problem 523. “Giraffe in the hotel”

A mother and her little son were relaxing at sea in an expensive hotel. When they returned home, it turned out that they had forgotten their son’s favorite toy - a stuffed giraffe. The child was very upset. Dad, in order to reassure his son, told him that the giraffe also “has the right to rest,” that he stayed at sea for a couple more days, and then wrote a letter to the hotel asking him to find and send a plush toy. How can hotel owners use this situation to their advantage?
