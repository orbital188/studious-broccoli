# Problem 786. Loading the ferry

Railroad ferries, which are used to deliver goods from one coast to another, can accommodate a fairly large number of carriages. Loaded wagons are heavy, so when they are loaded (unloaded) onto the ferry, its position in the water changes. The level of rail joining on the ferry and on land also changes. How to ensure that the rails remain level when loading (unloading) cars onto the ferry? Source(s): Technology - Youth, 2/75, p. 31
