# Problem 148. “Zoo without cages”

In 1907, Karl Hagenbeck opened the Stellingen Zoo in Germany, where animals were kept with maximum freedom, in pens without bars. When the zoo was being designed, a problem arose: how to protect spectators from predatory animals - leopards, lions, tigers? The traditional solution: dig a moat. It is clear that the ditch needs to be wide, its width should be at least 5 meters. Such a moat, of course, will not decorate the zoo. It would be nice to remove the ditch completely, or at least shorten it by a meter and a half, but a predator can jump over that distance. What should I do?
