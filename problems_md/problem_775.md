# Problem 977. “Marzi - an honest thief”

Once the king bet with the famous thief Marzi that he could steal the best horse from the royal stable. The king ordered to double the security, and not to take his eyes off the best stallion. Thirteen grooms began to guard the horse. Ten are sitting around, one is holding the tail, the other is holding the reins, and the third is sitting on horseback. How can you lead the horse here? It’s impossible not to take it by force, it’s impossible to take it secretly. Unless cunning will help.
