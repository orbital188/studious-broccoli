# Problem 1251. “Load soil with barrels”

It often happens that heavy-duty dump trucks that transport soil travel from the loading site to the unloading site for quite a long time. It is good if the soil is dry and loose. What if it’s damp or, even worse, frozen? During the voyage, it manages to cake and, when unloaded, separates very poorly from the metal body. Transport efficiency is reduced. How to “force” compacted soil to release the body of a dump truck?
