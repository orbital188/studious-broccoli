# Problem 1289. “Conflict at a meeting”

There is a meeting of department heads of a large enterprise. It is led by a newly appointed young director. He gives an incompetent order to an elderly, experienced employee. Everyone understands this. An experienced employee responds sharply and leaves the meeting, loudly slamming the door. The young director finds himself in a difficult situation: he must somehow react to the antics of an experienced employee, he must do something with the given order - delegate, insist, cancel. In any case, the director's authority is at risk. How to get out of the situation with the least losses?
