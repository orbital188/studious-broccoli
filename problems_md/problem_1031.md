# Problem 1267. “Soldier without a saber”

Once Peter the Great, having changed his clothes so as not to be recognized, was drinking with one of his guards. When the soldier ran out of money, he pawned his saber to the innkeeper, and instead put a wooden “training” one into the scabbard for show. Peter the Great was present. For tomorrow he announced a drill review, approached the guardsman and, knowing for sure that the soldier had a wooden copy in his sheath, ordered him: “Cut me with a saber!” How can a soldier get out of this situation?
