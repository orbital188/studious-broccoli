# Problem 960. “Double Strike”

The twins Tommy and Timmy were 9 years old. One day they were left alone at home, and it was at that moment that a thief broke into the house. On this day, Tommy was upstairs playing with his iron engine, and Timmy was practicing shooting at targets with a blowgun downstairs. Suddenly the boys heard the sound of broken glass. Tommy ran to the top of the stairs just as the thief was walking up the steps. As soon as the intruder looked up, Tommy brought his toy down on his head. Out of surprise, the thief fell and rolled down the steps, screaming in pain. And then Timmy ran out of the lower room with his blowgun. Seeing that the thief was getting up, he took aim and hit him right in the forehead. The robber grabbed his head and ran out of the house screaming. At a nearby hospital, the police found a suspicious guy with a huge bruise on his forehead and a deep wound on the top of his head. “A couple of hours ago, a robber was scared off in a house. You fit his description. You will have to proceed to the police station for questioning. - I didn’t break into anyone and didn’t see any brothers! I just fell and hurt myself! - the suspect protested. - But now I have no doubt that it was you. And your wounds are not at all the main proof of your guilt. What did the policeman mean?
