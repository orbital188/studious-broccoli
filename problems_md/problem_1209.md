# Problem 1456. “Don’t shoot!”

During the Chechen War (1994-96), eleven reconnaissance officers were returning from a combat mission across open terrain. Suddenly, a Russian helicopter appeared in the sky, preparing to attack a group of military men from the sky. The pilot could not determine from above that there were friendly people below. There was no point in shouting and waving at him from the ground. It's too late to contact the command by radio. How did the scouts manage to notify the helicopter pilot that they were “theirs”?
