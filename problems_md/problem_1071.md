# Problem 1311. “The Shoe Store Salesman Problem”

Early in the morning a buyer comes to a shoe store. He chooses a pair of shoes that he likes and fits in size. The price of a pair is $60. He gives the seller (store owner) a $100 bill. The seller does not have change for $100, so he goes to a nearby restaurant to change the bill. Instead of a $100 bill in a restaurant, the seller is given 10 $10 bills. The salesman returns to the shoe store, gives the customer a pair of shoes and $40 in change. Later that day, the restaurant owner comes into the store and tells the clerk that the $100 bill is counterfeit and demands his $100 back. The seller gives the restaurant owner $100. How much cash did the shoe store lose without taking into account the price of shoes sold?
