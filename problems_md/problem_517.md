# Problem 648. Drawn cartoons 

During the days of filming cartoons, a lot of drawings had to be made. There are 52 drawings in every meter of film, and a ten-minute film requires over 15,000 drawings! For example, a wolf swung at a hare - it would seem like one moment on the screen, but you need to make dozens of drawings. How can you make the process of creating many monotonous drawings easier?
