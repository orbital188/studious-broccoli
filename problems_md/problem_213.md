# Problem 272. “Rabbits are not only valuable fur”

In the 1920s, a new breed of rabbit, the Rex, was developed with valuable plush fur. The export of rabbits of this breed from Germany was prohibited. But the Soviet biologist Alexander Sergeevich Serebrovsky, who was there at that time on a scientific trip, returned home and bred these extraordinary rabbits in the USSR. How did he manage to do this? Source: Creative association “Flight of Thought” (Chelyabinsk)
