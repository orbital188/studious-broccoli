# Problem 519. “Dangerous electric vehicles”

Electric cars are becoming increasingly common as personal transportation, mainly due to their efficiency and environmental friendliness. However, it turned out that at low speeds (up to 18 mph = 29 km/h), the engines of such cars operate so quietly that pedestrians and cyclists often simply do not hear them. As a result, the risk of collisions increases and there is an increase in such accidents. What should I do?
