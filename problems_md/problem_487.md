# Problem 617. “From red to light blue”

The history of quantum mechanics begins at the end of the 19th century, when statistical physics encountered a paradox called the ultraviolet catastrophe. This collision was all the more unexpected because it was about a seemingly simple physical problem: a description of the radiation associated with the heating of a body, be it metal, stone or coal in a fireplace. For example, it is well known that the glow of a heated metal changes from red to light blue with increasing temperature. Why is this so?
