# Problem 1123. “Obsessive barrel organs”

Once, the Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi, already famous throughout Europe, while working on a new work, wanted to retire for a while in a quiet place. The choice fell on the small town of Moncalieri in northern Italy. But the town turned out to be not so quiet. Most of all, Verdi was bothered by the sounds of barrel organs, which came from literally everywhere. The composer tolerated them for some time, and then found a way to get rid of them. What did Verdi come up with so as not to hear organ organs on the streets of Moncalieri?
