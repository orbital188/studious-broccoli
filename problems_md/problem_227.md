# Problem 288. “With a rope on... a crocodile!”

Coast of the Amazon. Boat. There are crocodile catchers in the boat. Interestingly, they have no weapons, only rope. And with this rope you need to deprive the crocodile of its main weapon - its teeth. Tie his mouth? If you tie a crocodile's mouth, the teeth are neutralized, but a person does not have the strength to tighten the rope so tightly. How to do it?
