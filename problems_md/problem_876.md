# Problem 1102. “Communication on the football field”

In 1966, the teams of England and Argentina met at the FIFA World Cup. The match was judged by German referee Kreitleit. The match was quite tense, and the referee issued several warnings for incorrect play. But since the judge spoke only German, the offenders learned of their punishment only the next day from the newspapers. Over time, the language barrier at international matches was resolved by football referee Ken Aston, who invented and introduced yellow and red cards. But perhaps this is not the only way of communication between the referee and the players on the football field. How else can a referee announce his decisions to players during a match?
