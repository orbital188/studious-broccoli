# Problem 1333. Sacrificial cow 

In ancient times in the East, one king lost his mind and began to pretend to be a cow. He mooed, refused food and asked to be slaughtered as a sacred sacrifice. The court doctors could not do anything and decided to call Avicena to cure the king. Avicena asked to tell the king that the butcher would come to slaughter the cow and give the meat to the people. The king was delighted and began to look forward to death. Appearing at the palace under the guise of a butcher, Avicena ordered the “sacrificial cow” to be brought, examined “her” and rendered a verdict, after which the king abandoned the hunger strike, and after some time, thanks to abundant nutrition, recovered. What did Avicena say to the king?
