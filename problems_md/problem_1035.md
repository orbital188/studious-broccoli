# Problem 1271. “They chop wood, but the chips don’t fly”

Anyone who has stabbed thick cut logs with an ax knows that after each blow both the log and the logs fall and scatter in different directions. You have to bend down again, pick up the block and install it. Often you get more tired from bending like this than from working with an axe. Perhaps it is possible to somehow optimize the process and get rid of ineffective expenditure of physical energy? How to do it?
