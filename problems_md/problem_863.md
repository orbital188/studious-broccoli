# Problem 1087. “Rope in the cockpit of the stratospheric balloon”

In 1933, when creating the first Soviet stratospheric balloon with balloonists on board, the designers faced a problem. From the outside of the balloon, the end of a valve rope had to be inserted into the cabin with the pilots to control the stratospheric balloon. But the cabin had to be hermetically sealed - if the rarefied air of the stratosphere got inside the cabin through the gap between the rope and the edges of the hole, it would cause the death of the crew. How did they manage to pull a freely moving rope inside a hermetically sealed cabin?
