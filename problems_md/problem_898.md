# Problem 1127. “Tuareg weapons”

The Tuareg, a nomadic people of the Sahara Desert, have long considered iron an “impure” metal because they obtained it from an alloy of other metals. A devout Tuareg should not even touch iron. But Tuareg warriors always carried iron swords to protect their tribes from other desert nomads. How did the Tuaregs manage to resolve this contradiction, since there are no trees in the desert from which sword handles could be made?
