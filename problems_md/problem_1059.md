# Problem 1298. Collectible badge 

Once in the American state of Colorado, on highway 1-70, a column indicating the distance disappeared - 420 miles. The road workers installed a new one. He was kidnapped again. This was repeated over and over again until the cause of the disappearances became clear. As it turned out, the number 420 is symbolic for American marijuana smokers, who stole road signs “for souvenirs.” But there should be a sign at this point on the highway to inform passing drivers. How to protect a road sign from collector thieves?
