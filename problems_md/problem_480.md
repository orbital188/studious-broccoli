# Problem 609. “How the giant and Little Thumb measured their strength”

Once upon a time there lived a Little Thumb. One day he was grazing a cow in a meadow. The time was approaching lunch, and the boy had already taken out bread and a bundle of cottage cheese. But suddenly, from behind the tops of the trees that surrounded the meadow, the head of a giant appeared. This giant wanted to relax in the meadow and at the same time have a snack on the cow. But the brave boy did not want to give up the cow. “Hey, you!” - he shouted. — Do you think that if you have enough height, then everything is possible? Let's see if you have the strength to deal with me. - Wow, little fry. You know how strong I am! - the giant laughed so hard that the pines swayed. “I know or I don’t know,” Thumb Boy interrupted him, “just let’s measure our strength first, and then you can brag.” Whoever wins will get the meadow. - Well, come on! - the giant laughed. “Tell me, how will we measure strength?” “We’ll squeeze water out of stones,” said Thumb Boy. “Whoever squeezes more water out of a stone will be stronger.” The giant agreed, grabbed a large stone and squeezed as hard as he could. He pressed and pressed - he squeezed his palm, but did not squeeze out a drop. - Who presses like that?! - Little Thumb laughed. - Look at me! What did the boy do? Can he, small and weak, squeeze water out of a stone?
