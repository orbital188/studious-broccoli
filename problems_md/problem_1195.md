# Problem 1441. Age of sleepers

Since the development of railways in the 19th century, wooden sleepers have been laid under the rails. Over time, the sleepers became unusable. And road construction was not fast. For timely preventive replacement of sleepers - traffic safety depended on this - it was necessary to know exactly the date of their laying. For the USA, where railways across endless prairies were laid and maintained by different companies, at different times, under different conditions, this was especially relevant. How was it possible to resolve the problem and indicate the date of laying on the sleepers so that neither weather conditions nor natural wear and tear could erase this designation?
