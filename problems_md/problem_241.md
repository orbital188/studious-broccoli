# Problem 306. “Sum of numbers”

In the 19th century, a teacher asked his students to calculate the sum of all integers from one to one hundred. There were no computers or calculators back then, and the students began to conscientiously add up the numbers. And only one student found the correct answer in just a few seconds. It turned out to be Karl Friedrich Gauss, the future great mathematician. How did he do it? Source: Creative association Flight of Thought (Chelyabinsk)
