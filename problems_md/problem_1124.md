# Problem 1364. Monkey Hunt

The ability of monkeys to copy the actions of people is well known. Residents of some villages in the jungles of India have found a way to use this resource to catch monkeys with minimal effort. Having determined the place where a flock of animals is located in the trees, the catchers sit under the tree and defiantly begin to scoop in mugs and drink a drink from the can they brought with them. Then they leave the can and mugs and hide. Monkeys come down from the trees, begin to copy the actions of people and fall into the hands of hunters. How does this happen?
