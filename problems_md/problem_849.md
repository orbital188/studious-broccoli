# Problem 1070. “Kings can do anything”

In 1809, in Sweden, which was then dependent on Napoleonic France, Charles XIII replaced the deposed King Gustav IV. The new king was childless and, at the age of 64, suffered from dementia. In fact, the aristocracy that ruled the country at that time decided to elect a new king. The choice fell on one of Napoleon's brave and wealthy marshals, Jean-Baptiste-Jules Bernadotte, who was then 47 years old. Napoleon gave the go-ahead. Berandot agreed. But there was one problem: the marshal not only did not belong to the Swedish royal family, but also was not a 100% aristocrat in France. And yet the Swedish courtiers found a way to resolve this contradiction. How did they do it?
