# Problem 973. Shemyakin court 

There lived two brothers, a rich one and a poor one. The poor man ran out of firewood, so he went into the forest, chopped as much as he needed, but had nothing to haul the firewood with. He had to go to his rich brother and ask for a horse. He gave him a horse, but he was greedy and did not give him a harness. The poor man came to the forest and did not know what to do. He had nothing to harness the horse to the sleigh with. He grieved and tied the sleigh by the horse's tail. The horse pulled, but the tail came off. The rich man found out about this and dragged his poor brother to court. He demanded that he be punished. But the judge was a kind man and felt sorry for the poor man. He thought about it. What should he do? How to punish the poor man so that justice was carried out and the defendant was not harmed?
