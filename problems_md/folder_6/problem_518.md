# Problem 518. “Methane and lightning”

Methane (CH4) is an eternal satellite of underground coal mining. The gas forms a very explosive mixture with air. Degassing units, which suck this mixture into the atmosphere, end in above-ground pipes - the so-called “candles”. What if lightning strikes the plume of such a candle? There will definitely be a fire. How to avoid such a situation? Source: Sat. RTEZ 1999, Ed. ChuvSU, s. 24.
