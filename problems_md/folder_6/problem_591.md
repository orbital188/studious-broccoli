# Problem 591. Incident on the plane

Joke. The blonde bought an economy class ticket to Toronto. During the flight, she moved to the 1st class cabin and refused to move to her seat until the captain intervened. He walked up to the blonde and whispered something in her ear, after which she quickly returned to her seat with an apology. What did the pilot say to the blonde?
