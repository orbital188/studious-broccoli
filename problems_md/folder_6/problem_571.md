# Problem 571. “Lion with a torch”

The American writer Ernest Hemingway was sent a letter from England with the question: “Is it true that if you carry a torch in front of you, the lion will not rush?” It is clear that the writer is not a biologist and probably does not know the habits of animals. Common sense also suggests that the Englishman's judgment is most likely wrong. Try to answer for Hemingway. See. discussion of the problem in the forum
