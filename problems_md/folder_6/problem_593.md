# Problem 593. “Sword or saber”

The European knight of the 17th century - with a sword, in iron armor, in a helmet, with a shield - was, although slow, but a formidable warrior on the battlefield. It was quite difficult to pierce a strong shield or armor with a chopping blow from an ordinary sword. Another thing is the cutting saber, which had greater destructive power than a straight sword of the same weight. But the thin saber was “powerless” against iron armor, and European gunsmiths did not know how to forge a saber that would have the same striking power as a sword - the sabers broke. How did medieval gunsmiths overcome this situation?
