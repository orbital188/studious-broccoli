# Problem 595. “Fumigant and people”

Methyl bromide is widely used to kill harmful insects in grain storage facilities - it is a widely used fumigant. But it is toxic to people and is sorbed on the surfaces of containers, grain, and premises. Therefore, there is a contradiction associated with its use: for faster and more reliable destruction of insects, this fumigant must be used at high levels, and in order to quickly ventilate the room after treatment, the fumigant content must be reduced. How can the fumigant content be reduced so that people do not suffer? Source: Sat. RTEZ 1999, Ed. ChuvSU, s. 48.
