# Problem 531. “Big business starts with weapons”

In 1696, the Tula merchant Nikita Demidov received an order from Peter the Great to manufacture guns. Demidov was faced with a dilemma: sell one gun to the treasury for 10 rubles, as other gunsmiths did, risking being impaled for greed by order of the tsar, but still take a profit of 8 rubles from each gun? Or give them away almost at cost - 1 ruble 80 kopecks, but then how can you make a profit? Offer Dimidov a winning business strategy.
