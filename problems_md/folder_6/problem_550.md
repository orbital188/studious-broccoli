# Problem 550. “Cormorant-fisher”

Large cormorants can be used for fishing. The cormorant is tied by the leg to the owner's boat and released. It copes well with catching fish, but there is a problem with delivery: the cormorant is not stupid enough to carry fish into the boat. He just swallows it along the way. How can I stop him from doing this?
