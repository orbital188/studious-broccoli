# Problem 540. “To lubricate or not?”

In 1985, the 15-kilometer ski race was won by Swede Thomas Wassberg. There were several sections marked along the route where it was prohibited to use skating (at the beginning of the race). There was a problem: the traditional technique used in the exclusion zones involves the use of wax, but oiled skis will reduce the speed of skating in the crucial last part of the race. What should a racer do?
