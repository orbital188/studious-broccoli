# Problem 526. Kronstadt task of Peter the Great

Having conquered the mouth of the Neva, Peter the Great decided to build a large port on the island of Kotlin in the Gulf of Finland. Docks were needed for the construction and repair of ships. Peter did not want to build either dry or floating docks - it would be expensive, and most importantly, it would take a long time. What should I do?
