# Problem 527. “Electrolyte evaporation”

So that the aggressive electrolyte does not evaporate too much, and everything metal around does not rust, molten paraffin is usually poured on top of it into the galvanic bath. It does not interfere with dipping the workpieces into the bath, and it reduces the evaporation of the electrolyte. But, gradually evaporating, the paraffin itself covers the conveyors with a thick layer and disables them. What to do? Source: Sat. RTEZ 1999, Ed. ChuvSU, s. 24.
