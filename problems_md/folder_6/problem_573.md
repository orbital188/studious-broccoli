# Problem 573. “Taxes are sacred!?”

One NEPman (1920s, Russia) was taxed 10 billion. The deadline was the 10th. He brought the money on the 9th in the morning, did not protest and paid silently. - We have not taxed him enough - the inspector realized and asked for an additional 100 billion. The deadline was the 15th. He brought the money in the morning of the 14th. - Hey! - said the inspector. And he assessed a trillion. The deadline was the 20th. It is clear that the taxman will not leave him alone. But what should a businessman do?
