# Problem 514. “Pirates of the 20th century”

Modern pirates also like to rob ships at night. In small groups - 3-5 people - from their bases on the coast or islands, they rush to passing ships. But if you approach the ships closely on your boats, they will be detected by the sound of the engine. And if you row - you will not be able to keep up with the ship. What tricks do pirates use to approach a ship unnoticed?
