# Problem 504. “Robot Fight”

About a hundred years ago, an attraction was demonstrated at a New York exhibition. Two inventors, for a substantial fee, showed the audience a boxing match between two robots. The fight ended in the third round with a knockout of one of the opponents, who turned into a pile of metal and wires, from which smoke poured out with the acrid smell of burnt insulation. The inventors explained the high entrance fee to the pavilion by the difficulties of repairing the machine. But the attraction was open every day. Looking at the collapsed cars, people wondered how they could be repaired overnight. Try to understand how inventors managed to “raise robots to their feet.”
