# Problem 564. Oil coking

Almost half of the oil produced is heavy residue. Most of it goes to coke. Coking involves heating liquid raw materials to 500 degrees Celsius. Coke and steam are generated in the chamber. During the entire time of unloading coke, the chamber is steamed, cooled, the bottom is removed, and the coke is unloaded. This takes 24 hours, which is half the working time of the cameras. The coke that accumulates in the chamber is a hard and dense mass that is not easy to unload. Usually, a jet of water with a pressure of 100-150 hPa is used to cut coke into pieces. But then they have to be dried. What to do? Source: Sat. RTEZ 1999, Ed. ChuvSU, s. 25.
