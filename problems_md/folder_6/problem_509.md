# Problem 509. Landing on snow

Winter 1933. Pilot Ivanov needs to land on a site that is covered with freshly fallen snow. There is no way to determine the height from the ground from an airplane. This makes it impossible to accurately determine the moment of alignment upon landing. There's no point in getting your bearings. The likelihood of a disaster is high. And you need to land. What should a pilot do?
