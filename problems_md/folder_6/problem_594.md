# Problem 594. “Beach cleaning”

During the summer season, vacationers contaminate the sand of beaches with pathogenic bacteria - staphylococcus, streptococcus, and various fungi. The danger of infectious diseases is increasing. However, using strong disinfectants on the beach is dangerous. Disinfection will remove germs, but will poison the environment. If you do not disinfect, the environment will not be harmed, but the microbes will survive. Diseases will spread. What to do? Source: Sat. RTEZ 1999, Ed. ChuvSU, s. 46.
