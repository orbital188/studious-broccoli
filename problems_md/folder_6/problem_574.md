# Problem 574. “Clothes on the naked”

One European came to Africa and saw a naked aborigine. - Why don’t you wear clothes? - the European asked in surprise. The question itself already contains a hint of the backwardness of the aborigine - after all, “civilized Europeans” wear clothes. And the aborigines also have their own pride and dignity. Help the aborigine answer this question. See. discussion of the problem in the forum
