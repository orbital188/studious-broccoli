# Problem 566. “What to replace sand with?”

Sandblasters can be easily recognized from afar by their masks, which make work difficult and do not completely protect the respiratory tract from dust. You can get rid of dust only by eliminating sand, the very basis of the technological process. Initially, granular volatile fluorocarbons were used as a non-toxic and non-dusty shot for cleaning parts that went directly from a solid to a gaseous state. However, they turned out to be too soft and expensive. What should I do? What can replace sand? Source: Sat. RTEZ 1999, Ed. ChuvSU, s. 25.
