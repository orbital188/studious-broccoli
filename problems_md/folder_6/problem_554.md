# Problem 554. “When is the next elevator?”

Who loves queues? What about queues at work? Large corporations usually live in large buildings. Many people work and move around in them. There is only one means of transportation - an elevator. You can’t cut down forty floors of stairs. In one such company, queues accumulated at the elevators (apparently the architects made a mistake). Not only is this a decline in the company's image, it is a constant source of employee irritation and complaints. What should the company do?
