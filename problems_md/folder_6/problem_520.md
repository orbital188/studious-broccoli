# Problem 520. How to get rid of red clouds?

Replacing the air blown into open-hearth furnaces and converters during steel production with oxygen to speed up the process also had undesirable consequences. The injection of oxygen increased the temperature of the liquid metal to 2000-2200 degrees. The metal began to evaporate and burn. Thick red clouds of tiny particles of iron oxides hung over the metallurgical shops. A converter with a capacity of 100 t/h emitted 30-35 tons of dust per day. Gas cleaning installations do not capture this dust and wear out quickly. What to do? Source: Sat. RTEZ 1999, Ed. ChuvSU, s. 24.
