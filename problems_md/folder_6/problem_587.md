# Problem 587. “Rowdy people on the plane”

Airlines often face a situation where airplane passengers, fueled by a fair amount of alcohol, behave inappropriately on board the aircraft. There were even forced landings for this reason. Companies suffer financial losses, and the prestige of flights declines due to the threat to the comfort and safety of passengers. Deputies of the Russian State Duma, for example, in order to force tourists to maintain order on airplanes, propose equipping aircraft cabins with video recorders. This will help fight the consequences, but does not solve the problem itself. What should I do?
