# Problem 1132. “An incident at the border”

The city of Lourdes in France is famous for the miracles that occur there. One of its main attractions is a spring with “holy” water, for which devout Catholics come from all over the world. One foreigner who visited Lourdes was crossing customs. “What will you declare?” – the customs officer asked him. “I don’t have anything to declare.” “What’s in this bottle?” - the next question from the customs officer. - Holy water from Lourdes. The customs officer opened the bottle and sniffed: - But this is cognac! How did the foreigner react to this definition?
