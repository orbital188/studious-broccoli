# Problem 1009. Laser pointer

Many applications have already been found for the thin, powerful laser beam. Here's one of them. We've probably all seen the little red dot of a laser pointer. But the problem is that this toy is far from safe. If the output power of its beam exceeds 1 mW, then it can seriously damage the retina of the eye - and most pointers sold have three times this power. The market demands improved product safety. How do you see the new generation laser pointer?
