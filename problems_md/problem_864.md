# Problem 1088. Wine trade in Eliseev style

At the beginning of the 20th century, there was a law in Russia according to which it was forbidden to sell wine closer than a certain distance from the church. In St. Petersburg, one of the “wine” stores of entrepreneur Grigory Eliseev was subject to the law. An excise official came to Eliseev and demanded to close the store, which was located at the intersection of streets at the very edge of the designated territory. The entrepreneur asked for a delay of a day, and the next day he resolved the problem. How did he do it?
