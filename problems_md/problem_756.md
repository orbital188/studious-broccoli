# Problem 951. “Asepsis for partisans”

In operating rooms everything must be sterile, otherwise complications cannot be avoided. During the war, surgical operations sometimes had to be carried out in partisan detachments right in the forest. Of course, there were no specially equipped operating rooms. Medical instruments, dressings, and gowns were sterilized by boiling, but what about the air? There were no bactericidal lamps in the forest... How to ensure sterility of air for operations?
