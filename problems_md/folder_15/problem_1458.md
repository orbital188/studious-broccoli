# Problem 1458. “Queue at the airport”

At large airports, planes fly to the desired city every half hour. For example, first your airline’s plane departs, and thirty-five minutes later a competitor’s, then yours, then a competitor’s... Often, when checking in and buying tickets, queues accumulate - customers, saving their time, arrive at the airport almost before departure. If you don’t serve your customers quickly, they will fly away in half an hour on a competitor’s plane. What should your airline do?
