# Problem 1422. “The Riddle of Nostradamus”

The medieval astrologer Michel Nostradamus, to strengthen faith in his predictions, showed those who wanted the attraction “the creation of man.” Through a narrow gap in the door, spectators could observe how in the middle of the spacious room, under the “magic” spells of the magician, a human figure suddenly grew straight “out of the floor”. At the same time, the floor remained motionless. The human figure was depicted by a specially created life-size doll. How did Nostradamus manage to convince the audience that this figure appears out of nowhere?
