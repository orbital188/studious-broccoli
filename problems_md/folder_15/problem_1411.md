# Problem 1411. “On a narrow path”

Once the German writer Johann Wolfgang Goethe was walking through the park. On a path where only one person could pass, he met a familiar critic who constantly spoke bitterly about the writer’s works. “I never give way to fools!” - said the critic, clearly intending to insult Goethe. How can a writer adequately respond to such an insult using this situation?
