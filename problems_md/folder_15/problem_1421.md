# Problem 1421. Scarab Prison 

After fertilization, the female scarab beetle deposits larvae inside dung balls, which serve as a “feeder” for the larvae. Transforming into a pupa, the larva consumes nutrients inside this peculiar egg without touching the shell. The freed space is filled with larval excrement. Over time, the “shell” dries out in the sun and hardens so much that it can be difficult to break even with a stone. How does a newborn scarab beetle get out of its shell?
