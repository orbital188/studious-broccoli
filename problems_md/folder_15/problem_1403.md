# Problem 1403. “How many Spartans do you need?”

In the ancient Greek state of Sparta, the profession of a soldier was the most honorable. Under the leadership of King Agesilaus II (IV century BC), the Spartans waged numerous wars, attracting the armies of conquered states to their side. During one of the campaigns, the allies began to be indignant that they were sending entire armies into battle, and Sparta was only sending a small detachment. To maintain his power, Agesilaus needed to clearly prove that he had correctly distributed the forces in the army. How did he do this?
