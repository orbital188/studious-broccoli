# Problem 1438. “Don’t sleep on the table”

In 1837, a Parisian newspaper correspondent arrived in London to cover the coronation of Queen Victoria. There were no places in the hotels, and the journalist barely managed to persuade the owner of one tavern to let him spend the night at least somewhere under the roof. The owner of the tavern laid a mattress on the billiard table, and in the morning presented the bill, as if the journalist had not slept and played billiards all night. The journalist refused to pay the bill. The innkeeper sued and won the case. What argument did the innkeeper give to justify his demands for full payment for the rent of the billiard table?
