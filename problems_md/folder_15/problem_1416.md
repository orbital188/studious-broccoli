# Problem 1416. “The Tsar and the Philosopher”

Dionysius, the ruler of the city of Syracuse during the times of Ancient Greece, decided to somehow tease the philosopher Aristippus. During lunch in his palace, the king on the first day offered Aristippus the most honorable place at the table, and the next day he seated him at the very edge, which was considered an act of extreme disdain. “Well, how do you find your place today compared to yesterday?” - Dionysius sarcastically asked the philosopher, clearly intending to publicly humiliate him. How should Aristippus respond to the king in order to preserve his dignity in a delicate situation?
