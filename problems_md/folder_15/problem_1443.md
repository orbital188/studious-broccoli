# Problem 1443. “Illumination of the parachutist”

A parachutist equipped with lighting equipment, when landing in the dark, can, if necessary, illuminate the place of his landing or indicate his presence in the sky for those who are waiting for him on the ground. You can, of course, for this purpose, take with you in advance a powerful rechargeable battery that will power the electric lamps. And you can use existing resources for this purpose. How?
