# Problem 1453. “You have a letter!”

A scene from a theater performance. During the course of the play, actor 1, playing the general, brings and gives a letter to actor 2, playing Emperor Napoleon. Actor 2 must read the letter out loud. The text of the letter was written on paper, which was given to actor 1, so actor 2 did not learn this text by heart. Once actor-1 decided to play a trick on actor-2 and during the performance he handed him a blank sheet of paper instead of a letter. But Actor 2 parried the joke so much that, in the end, the audience booed Actor 1, who left the stage in disgrace. What did Actor-2 do?
