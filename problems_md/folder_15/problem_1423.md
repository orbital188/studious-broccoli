# Problem 1423. Greedy taxi drivers of Bangkok 

The passenger pays for the taxi ride according to the meter readings. The counter displays the mileage based on the number of revolutions of the car's wheels. Having thought about this, some enterprising taxi drivers in Bangkok, through a small design innovation, have found a way to “legally” charge passengers more money for less mileage. What did greedy taxi drivers come up with?
