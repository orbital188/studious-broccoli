# Problem 1449. “Smoking is harmful to health”

Many countries are conducting a targeted anti-tobacco campaign. In addition to the natural rise in price of cigarettes, it often includes aggressive social advertising in the media, frightening warnings and shocking pictures on cigarette packs, lectures by doctors, etc. The income of specialized tobacco shops directly depends on the effectiveness of the campaign. The owner of one of these shops, realizing that profits were about to decrease, began to look for a way to avoid this. At the same time, he focused on his regular customers, did not repurpose his business, and did not even change the range of products offered. How did the tobacco shop owner manage to maintain his income?
