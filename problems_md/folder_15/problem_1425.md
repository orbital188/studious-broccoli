# Problem 1425. Hot racing 

In Formula 1 racing, cars (bolides) reach very high speeds. It is necessary that the grip of the wheels on the asphalt is greatest. Therefore, for racing on dry asphalt, smooth tires without treads are used. At the same time, heated rubber increases traction. With this in mind, drivers often specifically warm up their car's tires during a warm-up run. How can this be done?
