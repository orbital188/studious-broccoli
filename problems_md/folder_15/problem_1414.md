# Problem 1414. “Three portraits”

Eastern parable. The powerful emir, who had lost one eye in battle, summoned artists and ordered his portrait to be painted. The first artist depicted the emir as he was - without an eye - and was executed. The second artist, taught by the experience of the first, decided to embellish the emir, depicted him with two eyes - and was also executed. The third artist received a large reward from the emir for his portrait. How did the artist manage to please the emir?
