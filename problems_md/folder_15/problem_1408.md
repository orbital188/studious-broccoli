# Problem 1408. “The Secret of Confession”

In Catholicism, only men can hear confessions from parishioners. Once, nuns from a monastery, citing female weaknesses, approached Pope John XXII with a request to allow them to confess to each other. The Pope was ready to agree, but decided to first check whether the nuns who had approached him were able to curb their curiosity, since confession presupposes complete secrecy. John XXII gave a box to the monastery and strictly instructed them not to open it. When the Pope came to the monastery a few days later, it turned out that the box had been opened after all. How did John XXII manage to clearly show the nuns that they could not confess each other?
