# Problem 1452. “Long unsuccessful siege”

In the Middle Ages, many territories of present-day Germany became battlefields for knights and their troops. Knights took refuge from the enemy in fortified cities, where, as a rule, large food supplies were often stored. Thus, in the middle of the 13th century, enemy troops surrounded the fortress of Thurant on the Moselle River. Realizing his dire situation, the knight who had taken refuge in the fortress decided to appeal to the mercy of the attackers. He began to share with them part of the food supplies that were abundant in the castle. The attackers happily accepted the offerings, as a result of which they were unable to effectively storm the fortress. As a result, the siege lasted about two years and ended with the signing of peace between the opposing sides. What did the knight share with the besiegers?
