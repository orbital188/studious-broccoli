# Problem 1417. “Cleanliness is the key to speed”

For almost all marine vessels, shellfish sticking to the bottom is a significant problem. At a minimum, the speed of the ship slows down, its maneuverability becomes more difficult, and fuel consumption increases. The process of cleaning the bottoms of ships from shellfish is quite labor-intensive, often with the help of divers or the ship entering a dry dock. But there is an easier way to rid the ship of excess ballast. How?
