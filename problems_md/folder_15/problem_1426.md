# Problem 1426. “Under Sails”

In the 17th century, multi-masted sailing ships plied the seas and oceans. To quickly unfold or furl huge panels of sails on a large ship, dozens of sailors climbed the masts at the same time. The boatswain supervised their work from the deck. At the same time, he could not always see from below where this or that sailor was on the mast and what he was doing: sometimes the visibility was poor, sometimes the sailors’ clothes blended into the background of the color of the sail. How did the sailors of the sailing fleet manage to solve this problem?
