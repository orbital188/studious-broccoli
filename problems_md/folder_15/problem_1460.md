# Problem 1460. Anti-freezing channel

Northern rivers and canals are usually covered with ice in the winter. For regular river navigation this is a significant problem. You can, of course, constantly heat the water with huge electric boilers, preventing the formation of an ice crust on the surface of the channel. But the cost of electricity that is required for this is not comparable to high. What is a cheaper way to ensure that rivers do not freeze?
