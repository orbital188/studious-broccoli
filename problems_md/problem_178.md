# Problem 229. “A bell as a gift”

Prince Zhi and ruler of the state of Chouyu. Do they have much in common? Neighbors. They “led” neighboring states, separated by completely impassable terrain. They were at enmity. They passionately wanted to conquer each other...And then one day they “became friends.” Prince Zhi ordered the casting of a large bell and offered it as a gift to Lord Choyu. He was very happy. But it seems in vain. Soon after receiving such a gift, to put it mildly, the state of Chouyu was destroyed. How did this happen? And what did the ruler of the state of Chouyu do wrong?
