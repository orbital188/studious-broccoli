# Problem 1052. Only for stagecoach passengers

In the 19th century in Prussia, stagecoaches traveled from city to city. They also carried passengers. Country roads were often washed out by rain and also passed through mountainous terrain. Horses could not always pull a heavy cart to the top of a hill. I had to push. But among the passengers there were aristocrats, people of “blue blood”. Pushing the stagecoach up the hill was not their job. How did stagecoach owners solve this problem?
