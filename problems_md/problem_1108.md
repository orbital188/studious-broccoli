# Problem 1348. “Your client gets in for free”

The company opened its store on the territory of a large entertainment complex. The place is visited, but there is an entrance fee. The company is afraid that customers who came through advertising will not want to pay for entry. A solution has been invented - right-of-way coupons. But the administration of the complex is against such coupons, since customers who enter using them will be able to visit the attractions located inside. How to guide your client for free, but so that the interests of the complex are not infringed?
