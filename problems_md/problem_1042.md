# Problem 1280. Horses on the Roof

In 1853, after a fire, the restoration of the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow began. At the top of the portico, it was decided to install, instead of the alabaster sculpture of Apollo that died in the fire, a sculptural group of bronze horses galloping in harness. According to the author of the sculpture, Peter Klodt von Jurgansburg, the rearing horses should “hover” over the portico. But how to achieve this? After all, the sculptures are huge, the only point of support for them is the horses’ hind legs, and the roof of the building does not allow the fastening pins to be fastened deep enough. How did Klodt solve this problem?
