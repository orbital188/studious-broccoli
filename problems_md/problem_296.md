# Problem 373. “How much is the little piece of gold?”

In 1983, several criminals were brought to trial in the Australian city of Perth. They were accused of stealing a large amount of gold bullion from the mint. Moreover, there was an interesting feature: they sold the stolen gold at a higher price than it was worth on the market. How did they manage to sell it for more than it was worth?
