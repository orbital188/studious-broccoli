# Problem 1266. “Cherry in half”

Cherry tomatoes differ from other tomato varieties in size. They are very small - only 10-30 grams. For better presentation, they are usually cut in half before serving as an appetizer. This is not so much a long process as it is a tedious one. Especially when there are going to be a lot of guests, and you need to “halve” a lot of cherry tomatoes. How can you speed up the process and evenly cut a dozen small tomatoes at once with one “light movement” of the knife?
