# Problem 391. “Will they become slaves?”

A long time ago, a Corinthian ship entered the port of Samos. There were many boys on board under constant supervision. Despite the vigilance of the guards, the Samians managed to talk to the boys. It turned out that the children from a noble family were captured by enemies and are now being taken to the royal court of Lydia, where the children will be turned into slaves. The Samians would like to free the boys, but in this case the wrath of the powerful king of Lydia will fall on the Samians. To refuse to help children will turn them into slaves. What should I do?
