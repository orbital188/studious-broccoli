# Problem 235. “Lock without a keyhole”

A thief breaks into a commercial bank by disabling the alarm system. In front of him is a safe with money. The thief takes out the master keys... and cannot find the keyhole in the safe door. While the attacker was desperately searching for where the castle was, a police squad arrived. How or on what principle does such a “secret” lock device work?
