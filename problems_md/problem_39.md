# Problem 56. “Is the painting a fake?”

An Austrian museum decided to buy a painting by a famous artist in France. Its authenticity was confirmed by competent experts. In their presence, the notary put a stamp on the back of the canvas, certifying its authenticity. In the Austrian museum, where it was delivered with all precautions, they carried out a second examination, and it turned out that the painting was a fake! Detectives analyzed the situation. It turned out that a group of French experts correctly determined that the painting was original. The notary's seal was also not copied. How did the substitution occur? Any versions?
