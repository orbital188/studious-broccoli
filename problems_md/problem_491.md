# Problem 622. “Injecting solution into a well”

Having drilled a water well, it is necessary to “de-clay” it, otherwise the access of water from the surrounding formation will be difficult. Drillers are trying to clean the pores of the well with strong water pressure. Large pieces are broken, but small particles of clay turn the water into jelly and clog the filter layers of the soil. Well productivity drops, so we have to drill again. What to do? Source: Sat. RTEZ 1999, Ed. ChuvSU, s. 58
