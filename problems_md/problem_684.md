# Problem 864. Skis with brakes

A considerable number of injuries that beginner skiers get are due to the fact that they accelerate too much and are unable to brake in time. It is probably not only a matter of skill - after all, the skiers are beginners. But also of the skis, and of the slope itself and its surface. Maybe of something else? So how can you brake in time?
