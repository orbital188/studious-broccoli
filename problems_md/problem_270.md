# Problem 341. “Welding a gold chain”

Gold chains are made in two stages: the gold wire is turned into a chain of links using a high-performance machine. Then you need to weld all the joints in the links. There are many links. Their sizes are small: 1 m of chain weighs 1 g. Welding by hand is ineffective. How to weld quickly and efficiently? Source: Sat. CRISIS - CNTI, 1992, p. 103.
