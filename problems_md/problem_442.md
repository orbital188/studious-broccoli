# Problem 568. Observers in the trees 

During the Great Patriotic War, during the fighting near Staraya Russa, the front line of the Soviet defense passed along the edge of the forest. To observe the enemy, Soviet soldiers had to climb pine trees. The pines began to sway under the weight of the human body. This immediately became noticeable against the background of motionless trees. The enemy realized what was happening and opened fire on the swaying pines. Soviet soldiers tried to stop the rocking, but this turned out to be almost impossible. And yet, the next day the soldiers were able to set up observation posts on these pine trees. The fascist soldiers no longer tried to fire at them. How was this done?
