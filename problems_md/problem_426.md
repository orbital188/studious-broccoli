# Problem 549. “Parking for a Ferrari”

One wealthy Chinese man, who was engaged in a business in the field of bank loans in New York, had to urgently leave the city for two weeks. Everything would be fine, but the Chinese had a car - a sports Ferrari worth $250,000. The owner was afraid to leave an expensive sports car in a regular city parking lot in case it was stolen! Parking in a specialized parking lot with enhanced security for the same luxury cars is expensive. What can be done in such a situation?
