# Problem 749. “Echelon in an open field”

During the Civil War, a “red” train consisting of several railway platforms carried airplanes. Somewhere near Rostov the train stopped - the locomotive was running out of coal.  The locomotive was uncoupled, and he went to the nearest station to get coal, leaving the train in the field. At that moment, a cavalry squadron of the “whites” appeared on the horizon. How can the escorts protect the train and protect the cargo?
