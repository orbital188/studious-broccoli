# Problem 352. “I want a statue!”

Conqueror! With a capital letter! Who comes to mind first? Macedonian - who else? Conquerors are conquerors because they wanted to be the coolest of all the cool. Having entered Jerusalem, Alexander the Great, by right of a conqueror, demanded that his statue be erected in all churches. But the local residents really didn’t want to do this - after all, the temple is a sanctuary. What should the natives do?
