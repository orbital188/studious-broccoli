# Problem 968. Sailor Fuchs

Captain Vrungel agreed to drive a school of herring across the Atlantic Ocean. But the problem is there are not enough people. There is no one on the yacht except Lom's assistant. Captain Lomu ordered to find an assistant. Lom brought a sailor named Fuchs. Fuchs said he was good with maps. But it soon became clear that Fuchs was a bad sailor. Fuchs doesn’t know the gear, he’s never even seen a compass, he doesn’t even know what the helm is called. And he really understands cards, just not sea cards, but playing cards. What should the captain do? How to quickly teach Fuchs to understand sea commands?
