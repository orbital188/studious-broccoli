# Problem 510. “Accident with a wheel!”

During the search for the missing plane (pilot Levanevsky), Vodopyanov’s crew, returning home, landed on Novaya Zemlya to replenish fuel. During landing, a small accident occurred - a sharp stone frozen into the ground cut the tire of one of the two-meter wheels. At the landing site, except for several iron barrels with gasoline, connected together by tight turns of a thick rope, there was nothing. There was nowhere to wait for help, especially since the polar night was approaching. What should the crew do?
