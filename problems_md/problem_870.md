# Problem 1096. “Swimming along a shallow river”

When a vessel moves along shallow rivers with a frequently changing fairway, it is very important to constantly, promptly and accurately determine the depth in order to promptly adjust the course. Modern highly sensitive echo sounders are an expensive pleasure. Not all river vessels have them. Using a hand lead - a rope with a weight on the end - is inconvenient, troublesome, and the vessel must be constantly stopped. How can one mechanically measure the depth of a river as the vessel moves constantly, promptly and accurately?
