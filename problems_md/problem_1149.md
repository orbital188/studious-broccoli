# Problem 1391. Free fruit

City authorities, as a rule, prefer to landscape megacities with “barren” trees - this makes it easier for public utilities to clean the streets. In San Francisco, one public organization that provides assistance to the homeless decided that fruit trees on the streets could become practically free suppliers of vitamins for those who are unable to purchase fruit in stores. But the city authorities, under threat of a fine for vandalism, prohibited members of the organization from planting fruit trees even near their homes. Then the social activists, without breaking the law, decided to force the trees already growing on the streets to bear edible fruits. How did the volunteers solve the problem?
