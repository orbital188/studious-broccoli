# Problem 1211. Fly Qantas planes! 

In 1988, the Hollywood film “Rain Man” was released. It received four Oscars and many other prestigious awards, and was liked by the audience, so many airlines, at the request of passengers, decided to show it during long flights. At the same time, only one scene in the film confused the airline owners. In it, the main character does not want to fly on any other airline except the Australian Qantas, explaining this by the fact that in the entire history of the existence of this air carrier, their passenger planes have never crashed. And although this fact is confirmed by statistics, airlines, naturally, could not afford such anti-advertising on board a flying aircraft. How did you solve the problem?
