# Problem 407. “Coke deposits on catalysts”

The production of benzene from its less valuable alkyl derivatives is carried out by the hydrodealkylation reaction - by reaction with hydrogen: CH3C6H5 + H2 = C6H6 + CH4. The process is carried out at a temperature of 700-800°C without a catalyst under a pressure of 20-70 atm (2-7 MPa). The disadvantage of this method is the use of expensive heat-resistant steel grades. During the process, coke is deposited on the reactor walls, which reduces the heat transfer coefficient, so the temperature of the reactor walls has to be increased more so that the reaction mixture reaches the required temperature. The use of catalysts containing chromium or noble metals allows the temperature to be reduced by 100°C. But coke is also deposited on the catalysts (as a result of a side reaction). Coke deposition deactivates the catalyst. To regenerate the catalyst, the process is interrupted, the reactor is cooled, blown with cold air to remove hydrocarbons, the coke is burned off by blowing hot air, cooled, blown with hydrocarbons, heated again and the process is continued with the activated catalyst. How to simplify the process and/or deactivate the catalyst? Source: Sat. CRISIS - CNTI, 1992, p. 108.
