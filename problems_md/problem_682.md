# Problem 862. “Traffic police for frogs”

Latest news! Frogs on the roads. Entire colonies cross the road. And they die under the wheels of cars - a mountain of frogs with a total weight of... twenty tons died in a year! And where and why? In Buckinghamshire in the UK. There they built a highway between two large lakes, which cut the frogs' domain in half. Frogs can no longer calmly wander from pond to pond and lay eggs where they are used to always doing this. Probably, you can build a fence along the highway. But it's expensive. How can we help the unfortunate tree frogs? By the way, how can we help other animals and insects? A huge number of living creatures - hedgehogs, small predators - die under the wheels of cars, and billions of insects die on the windshield of a car. Note According to Canadian zoologists, who for a number of years have studied the level of attentiveness of domestic animals when crossing the highway, geese are extremely rarely hit by the wheels. They are the ones who take the lead in this regard. Further, the list of the most “disciplined” looks like this: pigs, chickens, cats, dogs. By the way, among the latter the most inattentive are spaniels and lap dogs.
