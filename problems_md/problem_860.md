# Problem 1084. “Holes in teeth are from worms!”

In the mid-19th century, Chinese healers appeared in Moscow, who, among other things, treated the teeth of ordinary people. They claimed that holes in the teeth appear because small worms appear in the mouth and gnaw through the teeth. During the “treatment,” healers actually removed worms from the patients’ mouths. How did the Chinese manage to deceive gullible patients?
