# Problem 1326. Conventional language of guards

In the late 1940s, in the Lubyanka internal KGB prison, prisoners from different cells were prohibited from seeing each other in the corridors when moving to and from interrogations. This was monitored by the guards who escorted the prisoners. But the corridors in the prison are narrow and winding. In a straight line you can still see that another prisoner is moving towards you under escort. But what if the escort suddenly appears around the bend? It is necessary to somehow notify that the guard is leading a prisoner. But how? According to Solzhenitsynâ€™s memoirs, the guards at Lubyanka found a simple and effective way of notifying. How did they do it?
