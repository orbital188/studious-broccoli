# Problem 243. Doping at the races

During the races at the hippodrome of the Colombian capital, one of the horses picked up a frantic pace right from the start and came to the finish line first. The judges suspected something was wrong. However, the doping control showed nothing. From the behavior of the horse one could suspect that it had been spurred, but no spurs could be found. What “helped” the horse reach the finish line first?
