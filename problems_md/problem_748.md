# Problem 940. “Thunderstorm in a plastic bucket”

Two housewives were returning home after milking their cows. One was carrying milk in a metal bucket, the other in a plastic one. They were caught in a thunderstorm in the field, which they had to wait out under a spreading willow. At home, the owner of the plastic bucket was surprised to find that the milk in the bucket had curdled. Her surprise increased when she learned that her neighbor's milk in the metal bucket was fresh, as usual. How can this be explained?
