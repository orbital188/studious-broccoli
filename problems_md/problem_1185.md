# Problem 1429. “Quiet! The exam is in progress!”

A Georgian student studied at a Russian university. Due to illness, she was absent from classes for a long time. Knowing that she might not pass the exam, she asked her fellow countrymen to support her. And during the exam on the street under the window of the auditorium, young Georgians loudly, beautifully and for a long time sang the famous song “Suliko” in several voices. Meanwhile, the Georgian girl successfully passed the exam to the surprise of teachers and students. Everyone guessed that she had copied, but no one saw any cheat sheets on her. How did a Georgian girl manage to pass the exam? See the methodology for solving this and other problems at TRIZBOX.RU
