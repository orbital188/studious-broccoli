# Problem 1215. “Internet in Eskimo style”

The Internet in the 21st century has reached the inhabitants of the Far North. The Eskimos naturally had the question of naming a new phenomenon in their life. It was, of course, possible to introduce a familiar international designation into the Eskimo language. However, the experts decided to choose a word that, on the one hand, would denote the essence of the phenomenon itself - that is, unified computer networks for storing information, and on the other hand, was already in the habitual linguistic use of the Eskimos. What semantic meaning of the word did experts choose to denote the Internet in the Eskimo language? The Internet in the 21st century reached the inhabitants of the Far North.
