# Problem 524. “Victory of the “hares” - the controllers are “resting””

In the early 80s, students did not have the habit of buying tickets on trains. Some even boarded long-distance trains without a ticket. During the inspection, having become involved in altercations with the inspectors, the students offered to sing their favorite song. If the controllers like it, the guys move on; if they don’t like it, they obediently get out at the nearest stop. What song should I sing?
