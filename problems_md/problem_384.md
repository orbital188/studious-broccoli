# Problem 501. “Flags in hand!”

There was a rally of the Lithuanian Popular Front. Participants raised yellow-green-red Lithuanian flags. Suddenly representatives of the Interfront appeared in the crowd with a red flag, provoking the rally participants into a scandal and a fight. How can rally organizers avoid conflict and clashes?
