# Problem 530. “Fishing rod on the bus”

One fisherman bought himself a new fishing rod 5 meters long. He has to get home by bus, on which it is prohibited to transport objects longer than 4 meters. The fishing rod does not disassemble and does not bend. How can you pack a fishing rod to take it on a bus?
