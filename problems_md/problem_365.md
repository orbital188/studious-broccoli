# Problem 464. Stripping of electrodeposited products from the cathode

When depositing metals on a cathode by electrolysis, a problem arises: how to remove the deposited product from the electrode? Electrolysis forms a very dense and uniform layer of metal on the cathode,Â  in which some of the atoms are firmly bonded to each other. But they also firmly adhere to the material of the cathode itself. Therefore, the operation of removing a product from the cathode is called stripping; sometimes the cathode itself has to be destroyed by gouging out inside the product. This operation is very labor-intensive, and the product often gets damaged. How to make it easier to remove products from cathodes? Source: Sat. CRISIS - CNTI, 1992, p. 109.
