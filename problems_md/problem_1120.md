# Problem 1360. “Strictly vertical”

To determine the strictly vertical position of the structure when constructing houses and small buildings, a plumb line is used. It is a rope with a load. The free end of the rope is attached to the top of the structure being installed, and the load forces the rope to remain strictly vertical. Accordingly, the longer the rope, the more accurate the vertical reading. However, in practice, when carrying out construction work on the street, one problem often arises: the wind, which constantly shakes the plumb line. In such a situation, how can you fix the plumb line in a vertical position without increasing the mass of the load?
