# Problem 1109. “Three stores”

Three people opened three shops on the same street. All three stores have approximately the same range of products. To attract customers, the store owner on the right hung a notice on his door: “We have the lowest prices!” Looking at the neighbor, the store owner on the left also placed an advertising poster on the door of his store: “The best quality goods are here!” What slogan should the owner of an “average” store post to attract customers?
