# Problem 569. Cat-motorist

You just bought a new car and leave it outside the windows of your first floor apartment overnight. At night, a cat climbs onto the hood of a car and sleeps there. In the morning he stretches with pleasure and - oh. horror! – sharpens his claws on the shining surface of the hood. Naturally, it’s difficult to chase all the cats away from the car at night. It’s a shame not to pay attention. How to stop a cat from sleeping on the hood of a car?
