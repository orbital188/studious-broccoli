# Problem 1284. Crossing the elephants across the river

In 219 BC, during the Second Punic War, Hannibal, the ruler of Carthage, invaded Gaul. The wide Rhone River blocked the way further. Hannibal's army included many war elephants. It was decided to transport the elephants across the river on large rafts. But the rafts rocked on the waves. The elephants felt the unstable surface under their feet and did not want to go on the rafts at all. How did the commander manage to solve the problem?
