# Problem 1225. “Ascension Island is in the ocean”

In 1815, after the defeat at Waterloo, Napoleon I Bonaparte voluntarily surrendered to the British, who sent him into exile on the island of St. Helena in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Next to this island there was another one - a small uninhabited Ascension Island of volcanic origin. Here the British stationed a small garrison of soldiers to guard Napoleon. But, as it turned out, the state treasury did not provide for the maintenance of this land garrison - all the money was spent on maintaining the fleet. And yet, the commanders of Napoleon’s English guard found a way to get funding. How did they do this?
