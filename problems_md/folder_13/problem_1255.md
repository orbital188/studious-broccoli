# Problem 1255. Joining pipes

There are pipes of a certain length. The pipes are immersed in water to a sufficient depth (from 30 m or more). One pipe is buried in the soil of the shore. The second pipe is attached to the first. The procedure takes place under water. If there is water in the pipe, it sinks. If there is air in the pipe, it floats. By sealing the ends of the pipe tightly, it can be held in place. When two pipes are in a stable position, they can be fastened and proceed to connecting the third. How can two pipes be immersed and connected so that at the end there is no water in them and so that a person can pass from one pipe to another?  Possible starting solution: Each pipe has a baffle at one end. The pipe is filled with water and immersed to the desired depth using cables coming from the ship. Next, it is attached to the pipe that is fixed to the shore and in which the air is located in the following way: part c without a partition is applied to that part of the pipe where the partition is and where the pipe is fixed. The pipe is attached to one another. The partition has the following properties: it cannot open outward. The partition should be removed easily and not change the shape of the pipes. Subtask: what should this partition be like?
