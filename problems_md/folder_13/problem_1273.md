# Problem 1273. “Rapid formation of self-defense”

Attracting devoted adherents to new social structures is a long and troublesome task. But in case of emergency situations, there is simply no time for long-term and systematic campaigning. This was the case in Crimea before its annexation to Russia. Local public activists were aware of the threat from right-wing radical structures of a nationalist bent, headed by the Right Sector, striving for official power. Therefore, it was decided to immediately form local self-defense forces to build and protect checkpoints in the Isthmus area on the border of the peninsula. The fastest way to gather supporters was in the nearby cities of Armyansk and Krasnoperekopsk. It is logical that these should be combat-ready young men. But where to look for them? And how can we single out exactly those who share the views of supporters of Crimean autonomy and are ready to immediately join the local self-defense forces? Moreover, this must be done quickly, because time was a decisive factor in the confrontation between the political forces of Crimea and official Kyiv. Activists in Armyansk and Krasnoperekopsk in a matter of days formed the first detachment of forty people, who were immediately the first to defend the checkpoints. How did you manage to do this?
