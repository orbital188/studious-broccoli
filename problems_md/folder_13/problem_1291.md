# Problem 1291. “Around Athenian laws”

In ancient Greek Athens, all adopted laws and orders were written on a special board, which was displayed for public viewing. One day, residents of neighboring Sparta sent their ambassadors to Athens with a request to cancel some order. The Athenians agreed to the ambassadors' proposal, but a separate law in Athens strictly forbade removing the board with orders. But city residents found a way to circumvent the law. How did they do this?
