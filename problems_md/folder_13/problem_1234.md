# Problem 1234. “Koalas cross the road”

Koalas, Australia's quirky little bears, spend most of their lives hibernating among the branches of eucalyptus trees, the leaves of which are the animals' main source of food. When there are no leaves suitable for food on a tree, koalas move to another tree - they jump over or run across the ground. Where highways pass through eucalyptus forests, koalas sometimes die under the wheels of passing cars. How to protect animals from such death?
