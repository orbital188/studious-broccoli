# Problem 1208. Quick Cleaning

Construction of the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg began in 1754 and lasted eight years. Almost four thousand workers were involved. While working, they lived in temporary huts and sheds, which were installed right on the square in front of the Winter Palace. In the spring of 1762, the palace was built and was ready to receive Emperor Peter III. All that remained was to quickly clear the area of ​​rubbish and debris, which had accumulated in great abundance over the years of construction. To save both time and human resources, the then head of St. Petersburg, Chief of Police General Nikolai Andreevich Korf, made a decision, after which the square was cleared in just a couple of days. How did Corfu do it?
