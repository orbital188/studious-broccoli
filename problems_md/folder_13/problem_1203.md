# Problem 1203. Gamblers at War 

During World War II, in some places Americans who were prisoners in German camps were allowed to play cards from time to time. After this became known to intelligence, the US government ordered a manufacturing company to make special sets of playing cards, which were given to prisoners of war in Europe as humanitarian aid. Moreover, these cards could be used not only to pass the time by playing, but also in the event of an escape from captivity. How were playing cards supposed to help prisoners of war?
