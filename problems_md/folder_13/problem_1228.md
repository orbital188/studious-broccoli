# Problem 1228. At the Kabalev Concert

In the 1970s, Spanish opera singer Montserrat Caballe sometimes had to deal with a rather awkward situation during her recitals. Sometimes fans deliberately sat in the front rows with a tape recorder in their hands to record the singerâ€™s performance. Tape recorders back then were cassette recorders, and when one side of the tape was recorded, you had to turn the tape over. This bothered the singer. How did Monserat Caballe react to this behavior from fans during the concert?
