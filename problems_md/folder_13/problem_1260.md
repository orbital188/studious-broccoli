# Problem 1260. “Where should I take my friend?”

A dog in the house brings a lot of joy. But there is no less trouble with her. Perhaps the biggest problem arises when the owner needs to go somewhere and be separated from his beloved pet for a long time. Where to put the dog? Hire a special “nurse”?  But a dog can disobey a stranger. Should I take it to a nursery for a while? Expensive. Where should the dog be located during the owner's absence?
