# Problem 1244. “Predators without claws”

On the North American continent, there are small birds of the order Passeriformes - the American Shrike. They are predators and feed on insects, lizards and smaller birds. With a powerful hooked beak, the Shrike does not have claws on its feet. But the birds have found a way to hold on to the caught prey, eating it piece by piece. How do they do it?
