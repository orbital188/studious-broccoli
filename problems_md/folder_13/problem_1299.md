# Problem 1299. “Ants have a housing problem”

Lemon ants found in South America live only inside the cavities of woody plants of the genus Duroia hirsuta. Ants reproduce faster than new trees grow in which they can live. And although there are many other trees in the favorable climate of the tropical jungle, the ants have found a way to “cultivate” the growth of the duroya they need. How do ants do this?
