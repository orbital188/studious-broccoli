# Problem 1235. “The Prophet on the Screen”

In 1977, a film called “The Message” about the life of the Prophet Muhammad was released in Libya. The then leader of Libya, Muaammar Gaddafi, commissioned a film from an American director of Syrian origin, Mustafa Akkad, to promote the ideas of Islam. The director was faced with a problem. It was necessary to show the life of a man who became a Muslim prophet, but the Muslim religion prohibits the depiction of the Prophet Muhammad. How did the director manage to solve the problem?
