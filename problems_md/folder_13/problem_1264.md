# Problem 1264. Enterprising missionaries

The first Catholic missionaries in Africa encountered a wide variety of beliefs among the natives. At the same time, local residents did not consider it shameful to easily exchange one cult for another. The missionaries feared that, perceiving Catholicism in a similar way, newly minted adherents of Christianity would just as easily “change their faith”, regardless of the rituals, prayers and paraphernalia performed. How did missionaries in Africa at least formally manage to keep the natives in the fold of Catholicism?
