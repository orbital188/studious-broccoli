# Problem 1287. “Cooks under the control of clients”

Local cuisine is an essential part of the tourism business. In the Indian state of Kerala, the management of a restaurant at a hotel next to an ancient Hindu temple decided to give visitors the opportunity not only to try original exotic dishes, but also to “control” the process of their preparation. The service turned out to be very popular among customers, and the restaurant got good publicity thanks to it. How do restaurant visitors “control” the process of preparing the ordered dish?
