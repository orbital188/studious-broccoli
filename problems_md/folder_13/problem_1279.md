# Problem 1279. “Who will see the sun first”

Parable. In ancient times, in an eastern state, a king died who had no heirs. To decide who would rule the country after the death of the king, the inhabitants turned to the wise soothsayer and received the answer: the king will be the one whose slave first sees the sun immediately after the death of the ruler. At the appointed time, the rich residents sent the tallest slaves outside the city walls for the night. There all the slaves lined up at the line facing east. But the first to see the sun was a man who was looking in a completely different direction. His owner became the ruler of the country. How did this slave manage to get ahead of his rivals?
