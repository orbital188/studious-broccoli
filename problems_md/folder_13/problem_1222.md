# Problem 1222. “The Secret of the Vampire”

Most cephalopods, such as octopuses and cuttlefish, have adapted to defend themselves from their enemies by releasing a cloud of black liquid from a special sac in their body. While the “ink” dissolves in the water and the predator begins to see something, the mollusks have time to escape. But a mollusk called the vampire hell squid lives at a kilometer depth, where sunlight no longer penetrates. The water there itself is black. How does a mollusk protect itself from its enemies?
