# Problem 1285. “All roads lead to the cathedral”

In 1799, in St. Petersburg, by order of Emperor Paul I, a competition was announced for the design of the future Kazan Cathedral. In addition to aesthetic tasks, the architects participating in the competition also faced one “practical” task. According to Orthodox canons, the entrance to the temple had to be located in the west, and the location of the future cathedral assumed an entrance from Nevsky Prospekt - in the north. The Russian serf architect Andrei Voronikhin managed to solve this problem. According to his project, the construction of the Kazan Cathedral began in 1801. How did the architect resolve the contradiction?
