# Problem 1205. E-novel

In French, the letter “e” is most often used. As an experiment, the writer Georges Perec wrote a novel called “La disparition”, in which the letter “e” was not used even once. Published in 1969, the novel turned out to be quite successful and was translated into English, German, Italian and other languages. How did the translators manage to preserve the experimental nature of the novel?
