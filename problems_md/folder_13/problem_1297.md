Octopus meat is present in the traditional national cuisines of many peoples living on the ocean coast. As a rule, medium-sized octopuses are used for cooking, because their meat is not as tough as that of large individuals. At the same time, every cook knows that almost any meat can be made tender if it is properly beaten. The situation is similar with tough octopus meat. But you won’t be able to beat it in the traditional way with a hammer on a cutting board - it will fly apart into pieces. How to make tough squid meat tender, chop?
