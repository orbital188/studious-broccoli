# Problem 1212. “What was Remarque’s name?”

By 1933, when the Nazis came to power in Germany, the German writer Erich Maria Remarque had already won a name for himself in world literature and was even nominated for the Nobel Prize. The Nazis banned and burned Remarque's books because of their anti-war content. The writer himself was forced to emigrate. To discredit him in the eyes of public opinion, fascist propaganda created a myth about the writer’s Jewish origin. It was reported that he even changed his Jewish surname. What, according to Nazi propagandists, was Remarque's real name?
