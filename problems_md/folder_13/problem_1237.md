# Problem 1237. “Who’s on the machine?”

Perhaps every person had to contact different “serious” institutions by telephone more than once for some business. As a rule, the receiver at the other end of the line is not picked up right away - if they are picked up at all. What to do - this is a “serious” institution! The process of waiting itself is often accompanied by negative anxiety, which does not set the mood for the upcoming conversation in the best way. But you can turn these few seconds of languid excitement, until they “deign” to talk to you, into excited, impatient anticipation. How to do it?
