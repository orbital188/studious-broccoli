# Problem 1229. “Skiing on gravel”

In the 1960s, Soviet designers worked on the implementation of the Spiral aerospace project. It involved the creation of a special aircraft that was launched into orbit with the help of another aircraft and a rocket stage. First, an exact copy of the future orbital aircraft was built. Instead of wheels, it had disc skis. But during the first tests it turned out that the power of the aircraft’s engines was not enough to accelerate on disc skis on a gravel runway. However, the testers then managed to get the plane into the air. How?
