# Problem 1276. “How to catch a python”

The reticulated python, which is found in the Philippines and the Malay Archipelago, is the largest among its relatives. Its length can reach 10 meters. Many zoos around the world wanted to have such a “handsome animal.” With such a size, the reticulated python also has an aggressive nature, so it can pose quite a significant threat. A python can swallow a pig whole. However, the indigenous inhabitants of the Malay Archipelago have learned to catch these huge snakes, luring them directly into cages. How do the natives do this?
