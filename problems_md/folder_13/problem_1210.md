# Problem 1210. “Fishing with Velcro”

Sticky fish, which are found in tropical and subtropical oceanic waters, most often lead a parasitic lifestyle. The anterior dorsal fin of the clam is located closer to the head and is a powerful sucker. Therefore, fish ranging in size from 30 to 90 cm can attach themselves to larger sea creatures - sharks, turtles, and whales. In ancient times, the indigenous people of Mozambique and Madagascar learned to use this natural instinct to stick to fish. How did they do this?
