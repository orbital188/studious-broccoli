# Problem 1296. “Beware of the ostrich!”

Ostriches, 100-kilogram, three-meter flightless birds, have keen eyesight and always behave warily. When danger arises, they usually run away quickly. But if an ostrich is angry or protecting its young, it can be very dangerous. Then the bird pecks anyone who is shorter than him and can seriously injure him with a powerful blow from his paw with sharp claws. But on ostrich farms, it happens that the poultry farmer needs to get close to the giant bird in order to catch it. How can a person safely approach an ostrich?
