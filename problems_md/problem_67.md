# Problem 91. “Cast Iron Woman”

They say: “To break does not build.” However, demolishing an old house is sometimes no easier than building a new one. We have to resort to the “cast iron woman”, explosives and other crude methods. This takes a long time and creates a lot of noise. But if the house is made of reinforced concrete, and even more so, of pre-stressed concrete, then it will definitely not be a hassle. But maybe there are more effective ways than the “cast iron woman”? Let's try to come up with something?!
