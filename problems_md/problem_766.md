# Problem 961. “Confessed voluntarily”

Early in the morning, the director of the company discovered that he had been robbed and immediately called the police. “It looks like someone took the key to my little safe in the wall,” the director complained to the detective. - But I can’t understand how anyone could have taken it: I always have this key in my keychain. - Did you give these keys to anyone? - asked the detective. - Yes. Two of my employees, John and Ted, used my truck to deliver the goods. The key to the truck is in this bunch, but then they always gave it back to me. Besides, I always lock my office, and they were never even here. When John and Ted showed up at work, the detective spoke to each of them separately, saying the same thing: - Yesterday, the director's safe was broken into. Do you know anything about this? - Ted said: - He's locking his office. Sometimes he gives me a bunch of keys, but I didn't break into the safe! John said: - What are you talking about? Do you think I made a copy of the key and broke into the office last night? Look at this bunch! I don’t even know which key needs to be copied to open the safe! The detective was pleased: “The criminal gave himself away!”
