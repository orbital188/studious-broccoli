# Problem 470. Scrooge's Gold 

The Gubbs Brothers gang wants to steal all the gold from Scrooge's bank. They have a device that works like this: you spray a special liquid on an object, point the device and think about where you want to move this object. You press a button and the item instantly appears in the intended place. But how to sprinkle gold if the brothers can’t get into Scrooge’s vault? How did the Gubbs brothers solve this problem?
