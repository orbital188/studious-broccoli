# Problem 1147. Hello prisoners

In Colombia, since the 1960s, an armed guerrilla insurgency has not subsided in parallel with state power. Rebel groups hide in the mountains and hold captured government soldiers and police there for years. Prisoners do not have access to news, but are generally allowed to listen to local music-only radio stations. In 2011, Colombian authorities decided to use this to encourage and convey words of support to prisoners. How did they manage to do this?
