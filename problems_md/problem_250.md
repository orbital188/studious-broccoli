# Problem 315. “Error during the population census”

In the 70s, the next population census was carried out in the USSR. At the same time, the population was surveyed and standard forms were filled out. The collected information was processed using statistical methods. Then, based on the results, government planning authorities distributed public funds to various social programs. A year later, it turned out that pension contributions were incorrectly determined. They were planned based on the results of the census, much less than was actually necessary. How was the mistake made? Propose your hypotheses.
