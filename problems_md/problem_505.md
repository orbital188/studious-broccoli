# Problem 636. “Protagoras and his disciple”

In ancient times, the Greek law teacher Protagoras took a poor young man as a student. The teacher agreed to teach him for free on one condition: when the student learns and wins his first trial, he will pay Protagoras a certain amount. But, having received his education, the student did not appear in court. Protagoras sued his student, demanding payment of the amount promised to him. In court, the student said: “If I win this case, then by definition I will not have to pay Protagoras anything. If I lose this trial, then I will not win my first trial, and by agreement I must pay Protagoras only after I win my first trial. Thus, whether I win or lose this lawsuit, I still won’t have to pay.” Protagoras said in court: “If my former student loses this lawsuit, then by definition he will have to pay me the appropriate amount. If he wins this lawsuit, then he will thereby win his first trial and, by agreement, will have to pay me the debt. This means that whether he wins or loses this lawsuit, he will have to pay anyway.” Who is right: Protagoras or his student?
