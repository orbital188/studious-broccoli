# Problem 1436. “How to preserve the vaccine?”

In the 18th century Smallpox was rampant in the Spanish colonies in America. In Europe, by that time a vaccine had already been used against the terrible disease - the cowpox virus was injected, which people endured almost unnoticed for two weeks, but after that they did not suffer from the deadly human smallpox. The King of Spain ordered his personal physician to deliver the vaccine to the American colonies to stop the epidemic. But they did not yet know how to sterilely store a viral vaccine, and it was reckless to take a herd of smallpox-infected cows on board a ship. How can a doctor preserve vaccinia virus vaccine during a months-long voyage across the ocean?
