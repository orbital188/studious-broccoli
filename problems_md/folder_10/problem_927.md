# Problem 927. “The Art of Hatching”

You imagine this as a boring activity. All because you have no idea about the complexity of this work. Maybe you think that sparrows sit on eggs and wait for their chicks to hatch? Do you know how sensitive chicks growing in eggs are? There must be a certain temperature, appropriate humidity and unhindered gas exchange. Otherwise, the chicks will die before they hatch. How does a sparrow covered in feathers know for sure whether the eggs are overheated or hypothermic?
