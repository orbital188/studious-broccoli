# Problem 979. Curtain!

Variety clowns Z. Malkov and A. Tryapitsyn conceived a new skit. They want to satirically show the events happening behind the scenes before the actors go on stage: the artistsâ€™ anxiety, imperfections in the scenery and props, conflicts between the actors, stage workers, and the director. To make it abundantly clear that the action is taking place BEFORE the performance begins, the curtain must be closed. But then the audience will not see the scene. A half-open curtain also does not give the desired effect. The clowns tried a transparent curtain, but it distorted the image. How to show a closed curtain?
