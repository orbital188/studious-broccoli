# Problem 986. “Bad luck”

Giovannino found himself in a beautiful country. He walks and rejoices at how beautiful everything is around. Suddenly a local resident came towards him. “What kind of country is this?” - asked Giovannino. - This is Nestrana. A country where there are a lot of non-things. - How is that? — the traveler did not understand. And the local resident explained everything. It turns out that in a wonderful country, instead of sharpeners, schoolchildren carried with them non-sharpeners, which made entire pencils from pencil stubs. Instead of hangers, adults used non-hangers, from which clothes were simply removed when needed. There is no need to buy anything, because there is no money. Come and take what you want.  What other things do you think there are in this Non-Strana?
