# Problem 964. Hunting for a Cassowary

Australian natives showed travelers how they hunt cassowaries. A cassowary is an ostrich, only smaller and very cautious. These birds cannot fly, but they can run faster than a horse. It is very difficult to catch them, but if they manage to do so, the native tribe has enough food for several days. How do they catch cassowaries?
