# Problem 917. War with pigeons

Almost all cities have monuments to famous people. In almost all cities there are many pigeons living on the streets. In almost all cities, pigeons leave their droppings on monuments, clearly, although unconsciously, degrading the memory of these celebrities. An exception is the Churchill monument in Parliament Square in London, which is a life-size figure of an overweight man with a cane, wearing a coat and without a hat. Pigeons never sit on it. How did the creators of the monument achieve this?
