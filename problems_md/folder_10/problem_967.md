# Problem 967. “Fence on the main street of Berlin?”

During the time of Napoleon, behind the famous Brandenburg Gate of Berlin, the main street of the capital Unter den Linden began - “Street under the Linden Trees”. The street got its name for a reason – young linden trees were planted along it. When Napoleon entered Berlin, he was amazed that the roadway of the street was separated from the sidewalks by a strong and reliable fence. This did not happen in French cities. Why did the Germans put fences on the main street of the capital?
