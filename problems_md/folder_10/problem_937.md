# Problem 937. “Ink Lake”

In the center of Algeria there is an “ink” lake: the water in it has an inky color. And here’s what’s interesting: several rivers flow into the lake, and all of them have crystal clear water. There are also no substances at the bottom of the lake that could give the water an inky color. Where does the “ink” come from?
