# Problem 930. Gorky-Petrel

The bust genre in sculpture allows you to sculpt only the head and shoulders of the person being portrayed. Within this framework, you need to create the necessary image. The sculptor Shadr worked on a bust of young Gorky. To show the pathos of the writer’s struggle, his fearlessness, inflexibility, and inspiration, Shadr chooses the image of the Petrel from Gorky’s “Song of the Petrel.” But how can we show that Gorky is the same Petrel? Shouldn't we sculpt a bird next to the portrait? This is rude, and the bust genre does not allow it. What should a sculptor do in this case?
