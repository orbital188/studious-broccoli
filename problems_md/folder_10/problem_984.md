# Problem 984. “Cat with a bell”

We lived in a mouse's house. And the owner of that house had a cat. The cat did not let the mice live. They all gathered in the basement and began to decide how to escape from the cat. That's the question! You can't kill a cat - the owner will find a new one. You can't live in a house with a cat either. What can mice come up with?
