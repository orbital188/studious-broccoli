# Problem 922. “Leaking from a tank truck”

A tray is placed under the tanker truck on the vehicle chassis, which receives the radioactive solution flowing out of the tanker truck. This liquid is externally indistinguishable from ordinary water. The driver is deprived of the ability to control the container and pallet while driving. How can a driver determine the presence of a leak?
