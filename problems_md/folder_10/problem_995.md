# Problem 995. “How can a jaguar get drunk?”

In a dense southern forest lives a Jaguar. And in that forest there is only one lake. And in it live predatory fish piranhas. As soon as any animal bends down to drink water, the piranha immediately smells it - and grabs it by the nose. Painfully. But you also want to drink. How can a jaguar get drunk?
