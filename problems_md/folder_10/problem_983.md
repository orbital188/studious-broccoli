# Problem 983. Our song is good...

The Beatles, under a contract with a recording studio, had to release a small record - a single - with two songs. Usually such records contained one good song and one good song. The first side of the record was considered to be the one on which a good song was recorded. The number 1 was there. And the weaker song was located on side 2. But the Beatles wrote two great songs for this record. How to show that both songs are good?
