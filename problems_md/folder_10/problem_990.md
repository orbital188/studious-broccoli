# Problem 990. Invulnerable Guest 

One traveler got lost on the road and by nightfall ended up near a cave. Evil but cowardly giants lived in that cave. The traveler asked to spend the night, and they let him in. As soon as he lay down, the giants began to quietly, as it seemed to them, talk to each other. And they decided to kill the traveler at night with a blow from a club. The man heard all this and began to think how he could avoid death.
