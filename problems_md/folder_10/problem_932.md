# Problem 932. “Children are the flowers of life”

One farmer was haunted by his neighbor's children. They chose the lawn in front of his house for their noisy games. The constant running and screaming drove the farmer crazy. The first thing he did was yell at the boys. The result was zero, the “atrocities” continued. Then the farmer changed tactics. He talked about something with the boys once, twice... After a few days, peace reigned on the farm. What did the farmer offer the boys?
