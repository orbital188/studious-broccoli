# Problem 987. Mac 

Fuchs and Vrungel ended up in the Hawaiian Islands after a shipwreck.  It was hot, so they hung their clothes out to dry and fell asleep.  We woke up - there were no clothes! Only Vrungel still had his cap, which he never took off, and there was some money in it. They decided to fly from the islands by plane. The only problem is that there is not enough money. That's enough for one plane ticket and one suit. What should sailors do? You have to fly together, and no one will be allowed on board naked.
