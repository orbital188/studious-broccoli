# Problem 914. “So that people don’t steal sugar…”

In pre-revolutionary Russia, actors working under engagements often traveled around provincial towns with performances. At the same time, some simple provisions - for example, sugar - were sometimes carried with them to save money. And the hotel servants were not always clean. According to the memoirs of V. Gilyarovsky, the actor Ilkov came up with a very simple way to determine whether sugar was being stolen from the sugar bowl or not. How did he do it?
