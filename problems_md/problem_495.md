# Problem 626. “Washing wool”

Almost half the weight of the wool supplied by the harvesters is dirt: sand, dust, grease. And to wash a ton of wool, 40 tons of water are spent. Sherstemoen wastewater retains its harmful qualities for years due to fat, an emulsion present in the water in the form of tiny droplets. It was not easy to isolate this fat from wastewater before, when the wool was washed with soap and soda. With the transition to synthetic detergents (SMS - sulfonol-soda), the process of washing wool has accelerated. But all SMS are good emulsifiers, and they are difficult to treat wastewater from. What to do? Source: Sat. RTEZ 1999, Ed. ChuvSU, s. 59
