# Problem 557. “More marble for me...”

I've seen a lot of meaningless work. I saw how bad things were corrected. I saw how they cleaned up the garbage. But this is the first time that litter has been littered on purpose and on a large scale. Here, for example: at night, special workers enthusiastically scatter pieces of marble mined in a nearby quarry around the Parthenon. Do they have nothing else to do? Offer several hypotheses for their, to put it mildly, illogical behavior.
