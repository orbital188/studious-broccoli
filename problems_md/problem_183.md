# Problem 234. Constant temperature of the mold

In the production of plastic products, it is necessary to maintain a certain temperature of the mold. Overheating or underheating of the product leads to thermal shrinkage of the casting material, cracks appear and defects result. The traditional heating regulator in the form of a rheostat cannot cope with maintaining temperature stability. Try to find a solution to this problem.
