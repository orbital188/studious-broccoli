# Problem 535. “Lampoons against the cardinal”

Cardinal Mazarin (France, 18th century) ruled the French for many years. And how they didn’t like him in France! And so, at the beginning of his career, lampoons written about him began to circulate among the aristocratic community. What should Mazarin do? Imprison? You can’t transplant everyone, and it’s troublesome. In addition, they will hate Mazarin even more. So what should a cardinal do?
