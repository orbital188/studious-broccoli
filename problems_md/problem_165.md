# Problem 211. “Fragile ball”

Circus show. Timpani ring, under the bright light of the jupiters, a uniform player brings into the arena a metal ball slightly smaller than a football. The fact that the ball is metal does not raise any doubt among the audience - metallic shine, sufficient weight, a characteristic sound when placed on a pedestal. The magician - a teenager of about fourteen - takes the ball in his hands and... in front of the amazed audience, after a few minutes the ball crumbles into metal powder. What is the secret of focus?
