# Problem 500. “Looking for fingerprints”

Traditional fingerprinting methods are based on the fact that traces of natural secretions of human skin remain on the surface touched by hands. But such fingerprints can be erased or washed away completely. In addition, it all depends on the material on which the marks remain. Is it possible to take fingerprints, for example, from a pistol in some other way?
