# Problem 1263. Money for the Resistance Fund

After the defeat of Napoleon's army in Russia in the spring of 1813, the population of Prussia, which he conquered, became increasingly imbued with the spirit of opposition to the French. But the treasury did not have enough money to organize resistance at the state level. And then the Prussian princess Mariana figured out where to get the money. She appealed to wealthy women in Prussia to donate jewelry “to the resistance fund.” But it was not easy for noble ladies to part with their jewelry just like that. How did Princess Mariana manage to convince them to do this?
