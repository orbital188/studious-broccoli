# Problem 1388. “We see the invisible”

Since ancient times, spies of all countries and peoples often used sympathetic (invisible) ink to transmit data “to the center”. The most common were substances that appeared when the paper on which it was applied was heated – milk, wine vinegar, honey, soap, etc. The development of chemistry gave secret services the opportunity to use substances that appeared during chemical treatment of paper or under the influence of ultraviolet rays – ammonia, starch, table salt, etc. How can you detect inscriptions made with invisible ink on paper, regardless of their composition?
