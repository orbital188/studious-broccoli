# Problem 936. “So that the wheel doesn’t run away…”

Wheels of tower cranes are made with special protrusions - flanges, which prevent the wheel from jumping off the rails. But these flanges wear out quickly. The wheel has to be changed. But changing a wheel on a tower crane is not the same as on a car. The construction is stopped, powerful jacks are brought in, the crane is raised a few millimeters so that it does not tip over... It takes a long time and is very expensive. What can be invented to do the whole procedure in a few minutes and without expenses?
