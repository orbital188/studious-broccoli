# Problem 260. “Oxygen interceptor for polymer”

Substances that intercept oxygen, which is dissolved in the liquid monomer, are added to polymers obtained by a synthesis reaction when heated. This oxygen then slowly breaks down the resulting polymer. As such “interceptors”, in particular, finely ground metal powder, for example iron, is used, which must have a fresh, non-oxidized surface: Fe/FeO + O2 => Fe2O3. How to add such powder to the polymer? The use of a vacuum, inert or reducing environment will greatly complicate the equipment. What to do? Source: Sat. CRISIS - CNTI, 1992, p. 61.
