# Problem 717. “Battle in words”

Pushkin and his like-minded writers angrily and not always deservedly ridiculed their contemporary writer N. Polevoy. It was during that period that epigrams were in fashion. And they rained down on Polevoy. Polevoy himself was a good writer; he was also good at parody poems. But the epigrams did not turn out to be as sharp and evil as Pushkin’s. Therefore, he could not answer with an epigram - this would have caused additional ridicule. It also makes no sense to respond with a parody of Pushkin’s poems, since this will no longer be a response to epigrams. How to fight off undeserved attacks?
