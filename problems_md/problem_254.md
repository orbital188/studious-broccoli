# Problem 321. “The level around the corner”

One day at a construction site a problem arose: it was necessary to measure the horizontality of a slab located behind the bend of the ventilation duct. It’s easy to make such a measurement using a regular liquid level with an air bubble, but the trouble is, you can still stick the level in there, but you can’t look into it. We spent half a day trying to somehow adjust the mirrors, then decided to break the already finished concrete wall. Is it possible to do without this? Source: Creative association “Flight of Thought” (Chelyabinsk)
