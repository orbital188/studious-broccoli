# Problem 206. “Little imp in a box”

Everyone knows the little devil in a box toy. It is a box with a small figurine of an imp and a compressed spring inside. Open the lid and the figure jumps out. But the spring, after a number of cycles of operation, loses its elasticity. Offer an “eternal” straightening device. Source: Creative association “Flight of Thought” (Chelyabinsk)
