# Problem 1166. “I don’t see anything!”

It is known that if you quickly enter a dark room from a brightly lit room, your eyes need some time to adapt to the new lighting conditions. Thus, some sailors on old sailing ships often had to frequently go down into the dark hold and immediately get out again onto the deck. The “sea wolves” knew how to “force” the eyes to quickly adapt to sudden changes in light. How did sailors do it in the old days?
