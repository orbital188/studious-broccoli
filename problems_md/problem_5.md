# Problem 6. “Repairing networks”

Spiders weave webs at night or early in the morning. Moreover, these networks do not last long. Why? It’s just that in dry air the sticky substance changes its consistency and the strength of the network decreases. Beetles, bumblebees and other large insects tear apart the web. Therefore, after one or two nights the spider has to renew the network. Such weak networks need to be constantly repaired, and this leads to a large consumption of building material. So you won’t get enough material. How did spiders solve this problem?
