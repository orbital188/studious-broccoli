# Problem 1420. “Note in the egg”

In Europe, during the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), conspirators often used ordinary raw chicken eggs for secret correspondence. Inside the egg, under the shell, a message was placed on a small piece of paper. By breaking the egg, the recipient received a message. How did you manage to put a note inside a raw egg?
