# Problem 162. Evaporation of oil

Oil storage tanks experience losses due to evaporation.  There is a known storage method in which the surface of the oil is covered with floating screens.  Evaporation reduces sharply if the gap between the screen and the wall is small. But the wall deforms under the influence of changing loads and interferes with the free movement of the screen.  With a large gap, the screen moves freely, but the oil evaporates greatly. What to do?
