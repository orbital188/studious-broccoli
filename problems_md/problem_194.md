# Problem 250. “Is your fur coat cold?”

It's cold in winter. It is known that a fur coat helps against the cold. However, the surface of the animal's body is convex, the fur at the tops of the hair will be loose, and the cold can creep into the animal's body. But the muskrat's hair is arranged in such a way that the fur does not fluff up. How is her fur coat made? Offer options.
