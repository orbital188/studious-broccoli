# Problem 1167. “Everybody dance!”

Music on modern dance floors is usually quite loud. It’s good if the building of a disco or club is located away from residential buildings. Loud music does not disturb people, but it is not always convenient for visitors: you still have to get to the club somehow. Naturally, this is not profitable for dance floor owners. If the dance floor is located on the ground floor of the house, then residents of the upper floors experience noticeable discomfort. But the owners of some popular discos in Europe have found a way to solve this problem. How did they do this?
