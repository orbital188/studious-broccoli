# Problem 1082. Half-fainting at the Queen's reception

In England, during the time of Queen Victoria, Windsor Castle often hosted lavish, ceremonial receptions that lasted for hours. During one of them, Lady Russell became so ill that she could not stand on her feet. It was against court etiquette to sit in the presence of the Queen and in full view of all the ladies of the court. It was also against court etiquette to leave during the reception. Seeing Lady Russell's condition, Queen Victoria herself offered her a way out of the awkward situation. How did she do it?
