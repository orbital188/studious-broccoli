# Problem 506. “Miracle wallpaper glue”

When gluing wallpaper, it is difficult to apply glue evenly on it. In some places there is none at all, but in others there is too much and the wallpaper swells. It would be nice if the glue was painted, but then it will show through the wallpaper. What should I do?
