# Problem 693. “Forced “fast” chess”

Depending on the time allotted for the game, chess is divided into “regular” and “fast”. For modern classical chess, the time limit is usually set at 2 hours for 40 moves plus an additional hour for the next 20 moves. In “fast” chess, the time limit is up to 30 minutes. And there are also blitz tournaments - 5-15 minutes per game. How can we make chess essentially become fast chess - so that it is impossible to play it for more than a certain short time? Offer options.
