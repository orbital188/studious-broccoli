# Problem 1106. “Death to cockroaches!”

Cockroaches are omnivorous insects and very unpretentious to practically living conditions. If they appear, then getting rid of them becomes very problematic.

For example, inside a telephone, a coffee grinder, or even a computer keyboard? How to get them out of there?
