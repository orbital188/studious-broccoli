# Problem 929. “How to measure part of an ingot?”

When producing steel pipes, it is important to cut a billet from an ingot of exactly the specified mass, then all pipes will have the same length. But how? Ingots of different sizes and shapes. Many sensors can be used to detect shapes and sizes by connecting them to a computer, but this is very difficult. Is it possible to solve the problem in a simpler way?
