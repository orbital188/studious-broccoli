# Problem 712. “A thought expressed is a lie”

Let's say there are only negative characters in the play. But in addition to the characters' actions, the author would like to express some of his own - positive - thoughts. Only one of the characters can say them. But a negative character cannot say positive things - it would be unnatural. How can one express positive thoughts without risking the naturalness of the character?
