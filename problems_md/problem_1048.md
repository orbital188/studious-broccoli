# Problem 1286. Plevako's argument 

At the end of the 19th century. one Russian landowner, on parole, gave part of his land to the peasants for use because they built a road to his estate. The deal was not legally formalized, and after the death of the landowner, his son demanded the land back from the peasants. After the peasants rebelled, they were arrested and put on trial. The defender of the peasants was lawyer F.N. Plevako. He listened to all the arguments of the prosecution without a single objection, and during his speech he even called on the judges to impose an even more severe sentence on the peasants and gave an argument after which the jury acquitted all the defendants. What argument did the lawyer make?
