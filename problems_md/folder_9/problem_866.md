# Problem 866. Bandaging Magpies 

A park of one of the schools in the Australian city of Brisbane was chosen by magpies. At first, everything went well - children and magpies got along well together. But then the magpies hatched chicks, and the birds became very aggressive: they pounced on everyone who passed by from behind, saving their offspring. Do you understand the state of children, teachers, parents? Horror! And the decision to match. The indignant parents, tired of meeting crying children, decided to exterminate the magpies. No magpies - no problem! But it was a very cruel proposal. However, a good solution was found by the animal protection society. Which one? Let's look!
