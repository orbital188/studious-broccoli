# Problem 809. “Rules of space traffic”

Once upon a time, the famous space explorer Iyon Tikhy took an exam for his right to drive spaceships. The examiner, Professor Tarantoga, asked a simple question: “The spacecraft is in orbit around the Earth’s satellite. Can it orbit the earth twice as fast in the same orbit?” Iion Tikhy finds it difficult to answer this question. Tell him. See discussion of the problem in the forum
