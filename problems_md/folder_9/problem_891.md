# Problem 891. “How Napoleon deceived the Austrians”

In 1805, during the war, the troops of Napoleon Bonaparte practically surrounded the Austrian army of General Mack, which was holed up in the Ulm fortress. The Emperor assumed that the Austrians could withdraw from their fortresses to join the advancing army of Kutuzov. To prevent this, Napoleon sent his secret spy Karl Schulmeister to the Austrians. He told Mack that the British had landed in Boulogne, there was an uprising in Paris, and Napoleon was returning to France. This news initially aroused the general’s distrust, but the spy presented strong evidence, which Napoleon had provided him with in advance. What did the spy present to the Austrians?
