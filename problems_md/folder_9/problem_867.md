# Problem 867. “Alcohol that disappeared from under the seal”

Russia. An AN-24 aircraft with a single passenger on board. The crew are former military pilots, decommissioned from combat vehicles. The cargo used was sealed iron cans with alcohol (milk was previously transported in similar vessels). Each can is hermetically closed and sealed. Who can resist trying to “feast on alcohol”? So, the plane arrives at its destination. The seals were not broken, and half a liter of alcohol was missing from each flask. Clarify the situation. How and why did the alcohol disappear?
