# Problem 871. “Weeping icons”

Once upon a time, the faces of saints in Russian churches began to shed tears from lamp oil. This happened under Peter I. The clergy simply wanted to pity Peter I, who intended to pour what he thought were unnecessary bells into cannons. As you know, the formidable king did not deal with the reasons, but threatened the clergy with rods, prohibited propaganda crying, which was obediently carried out. History repeated itself. But at another time and in another place. In the 90s of the 20th century, in the Orthodox Church of St. Nicholas (Chicago, USA), the icon of the Virgin Mary also began to cry. More than 300 thousand people - believers and non-believers - flocked to the temple to witness the miracle. Scientists also became interested in the religious sensation. When they asked permission to examine the icon, they were resolutely refused, and the holy tears just as unexpectedly dried up. This, however, did not bother the American physicist Sean Carlson, who decided to repeat the experiment using his own method. And he repeated the Miracle. I wonder how it all worked out? What was the essence of this phenomenon?
