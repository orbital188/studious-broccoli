# Problem 850. “Learn about the life of nomads”

Tourists in foreign exotic countries often want to learn as much as possible about the local population. In Yemen, where a large number of nomadic tribes live in the deserts, they have found a very original way to do this, with the help of which tourists fully understand not only the culture and customs of the local population, but also the laws of hospitality. How do nomadic tribes introduce tourists to their way of life?
