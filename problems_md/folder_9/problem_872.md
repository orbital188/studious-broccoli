# Problem 872. “The Builder Pericles”

During the 15 years of the reign of Pericles (around the 5th century BC), temples, altars, and sculptures of extraordinary beauty were built in Athens. Pericles involved a large number of citizens in the construction, which “provided them with prosperity and turned them away from inaction and idleness.” The inscriptions on the buildings indicated that the construction was carried out at public expense. Pericles' enemies accused him of wastefulness, of wasting state revenues. Then, according to Plutarch, Pericles asked the people at the meeting whether he thought the costs were too high? The answer was that it was a lot. What do you think Pericles answered to the people?
