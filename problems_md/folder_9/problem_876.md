# Problem 876. “Sophia was offended”

After defending her dissertation at the University of Göttingen in 1874, Sofya Kovalevskaya, inspired, returned home. Still would! She was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, and with the highest praise, which not many men received. Alas, in Russia the attitude towards the learned lady was more than cool. Kovalevskaya's journey through the bureaucracy brought little benefit - only permission to teach at the university. In the next office, along with the official refusal, Kovalevskaya heard this boorish verbal addition: “We have always had men doing this. They coped with their responsibilities well. We don’t need any innovations!” Sofya Vasilievna got angry and answered with dignity. How would you answer?
