# Problem 835. “Two Dwarves”

At the crossroads of two roads there are two gnomes. One of them always tells the truth. The other one always lies. You don't know which one is which. (And they know). You don’t know which of the two roads leads to the goal. (And they know). You can find out which path you should take by asking just one question to just one gnome. What kind of question is this?
