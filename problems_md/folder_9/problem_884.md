# Problem 884. “How long does a round last?”

Cockfighting on the Indonesian island of Bali is one of the long-standing and popular entertainments of local residents. Like other martial arts, cockfighting is divided into rounds. Judges traditionally count the time of the rounds in the same way as was done in ancient times, when the aborigines did not yet know any clocks. How do they count the time of cockfighting on the island of Bali?
