# Problem 875. Chinese translation

Manichaeism is an ancient Persian doctrine of the eternal struggle between the forces of Light and Darkness. Good and evil are presented in it as the original and equal principles of existence. The founder of the doctrine, Mani (216 - 274), preached it in Persia, Central Asia, and India. Manichaean works began to be translated into Chinese in the 8th century. Long before the sect was officially allowed in China. The question immediately arose: how to translate the name of the teacher Mani himself? Maybe just transcribe it? But then it is unlikely that the Chinese will recognize a certain teacher with an “incomprehensible” name as one of their own.
