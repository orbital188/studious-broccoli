# Problem 897. “How the Karakum Canal was saved”

The Karakum Canal, over 1,000 kilometers long, was built for irrigation. But already in the first year of operation, in 1955, it found itself in a catastrophic situation - it was completely overgrown. The speed of the water flow has decreased. Hundreds of thousands of hectares of cotton did not receive moisture and dried out. The situation seemed hopeless. How to clear the canal of vegetation at such a vast distance and in an extremely short time? Suggest your ideas.
