# Problem 869. “Horse from the Zoo”

The famous sculptor Sergei Konenkov made a portrait of academician Ivan Petrovich Pavlov - he posed for him every day. A car was sent from the workshop to pick him up. But one day the academician asked to send for him an old carriage, the kind he rode in in his youth, because he was tired of the car with its smoke and stench... They searched for the horse a little in the suburbs of Leningrad, but did not find it. We went to the zoo, where we rode children along the alleys on a horse. But that little horse turned out to be obstinate, and no matter how hard she was pulled, she didn’t want to go outside the zoo. Why? Offer hypotheses - what's the big deal?
