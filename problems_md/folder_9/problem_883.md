# Problem 883. “Overseas herring caviar”

During spawning, small North Atlantic herring gather near the shore at a depth of up to 2 m in huge schools, releasing masses of fertilized eggs. The Eskimos of Alaska prepare it for their future use, taking only caviar from the sea, not fish. How do they do it?
