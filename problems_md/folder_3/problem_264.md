# Problem 264. How to sleep in space?

Chronic insomnia can lead to decreased performance, memory impairment, and even illness. Sleep disorders are a serious problem on Earth, let alone on the International Space Station (ISS). In difficult conditions of constant noise and weightlessness, it is quite difficult to fall asleep. As a result, about half of the astronauts are forced to take appropriate medications, which can cause addiction and will not allow them to wake up in time in the event of an emergency. How can you help astronauts get enough sleep?
