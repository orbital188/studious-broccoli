# Problem 268. “Conversation with a chimpanzee”

Attempts to teach baby apes to speak were unsuccessful. They learned to understand many words, but could barely pronounce a few. The experiment's failure was not because the ape was lazy or stupid - it was simply because their vocal apparatus was not adapted to reproduce the sounds of human speech. How can one talk to apes?
