# Problem 249. “Deceived the cunning people”

During the filming of V. Peskov's movie about the life of Alaskan animals, American filmmakers were amazed to see five fox cubs frolicking in front of the camera. Foxes are very timid animals, and it seemed impossible to film such an episode - fox cubs do not allow people to get close. How did they manage to film the fox cubs up close?
