# Problem 242. “Where to hide the body?”

In ancient times, when rich people died, they “took” a lot of jewelry with them to the grave. Such a tomb is a treasure trove for thieves. So friends and relatives were racking their brains: how to preserve the “goods” of the deceased. Egyptian pharaohs were walled up in impregnable pyramids. Macedonian was hidden under water in one of the branches of the Nile. But Genghis Khan was buried in a large mound. But the fresh mound is immediately noticeable. How to hide traces of burial?
