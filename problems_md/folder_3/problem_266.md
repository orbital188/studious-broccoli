# Problem 266. Rock in a boxing glove 

During a professional boxing match, athletes and their coaches were faced with a mystery. A fairly average boxer surprisingly scored a string of victories over medal candidates, all by knockout. The losers said that at the beginning of the fight his blows were ordinary, but gradually became stronger, reaching after a while such force as if the boxer was hitting not with an ordinary glove, but with a stone. But the judge checks the gloves before the fight; you can’t hide a cobblestone in them.
