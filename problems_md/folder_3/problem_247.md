# Problem 247. “Unmasking! Why?”

For a long time, entomologists found the actions of some species of spiders mysterious. It would seem that the more inconspicuously the web is woven, the better for its owner - more often insects will be caught. But there are strange thickenings on some webs, clearly giving them away. The thickened areas of the web have different shapes: sometimes in the form of circles, sometimes in the form of crosses or lines. Why did the spider need this art?
