# Problem 224. “Crows ruin “life” in the Kremlin”

Crows feel very at ease in the Kremlin: they peck sealant from the seams on the roof, dirty buildings and even ride on their tails from the domes. They hunt crows with the help of hawks. But when they are released into the sky, the crows in a friendly group swoop down on them and do not allow them to rise. They understand: if the hawk gains altitude, one of the crows will die... What can be done to prevent the crows from darkening the life of the Kremlin?
