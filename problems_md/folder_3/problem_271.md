# Problem 271. “Wrong” clock

One woman lived in a 12-room apartment. She had a clock in every room. One Saturday evening in late October, she set all the clocks to daylight saving time and went to bed. When she woke up the next morning, she discovered that only two dials showed the correct time. Explain how this could happen? Source: Creative association “Flight of Thought” (Chelyabinsk)
