# Problem 207. “All roads lead to the temple”

The ancient temple of Garni is an Armenian shrine located on the top of the mountain. There are stairs leading to the temple. In the temple you need to behave accordingly: restrained, respectful. But, alas! Neither the persuasion of the guides, nor the signs have any effect on other tourists... How can you force tourists to behave with dignity in the temple (of course, you can’t fine them in the temple)?
