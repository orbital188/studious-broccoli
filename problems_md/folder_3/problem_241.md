# Problem 241. “Oil combustion during hardening of parts”

When hardening steel parts, the hot parts are quickly and smoothly lowered into a bath of oil using a crane.  The oil boils (thereby quickly cooling and hardening the part), and its vapor comes into contact with the hot upper part of the part and burns. They burn with a highly smoky flame, staining the surrounding walls and equipment of the workshop with soot. How to get rid of this harmful pollution? Source: Sat. CRISIS - CNTI, 1992, p. 61.
