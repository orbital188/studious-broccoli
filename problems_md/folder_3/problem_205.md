# Problem 205. “Dull scalpel”

A scalpel is a sharp thing. A dull scalpel in the hands of a surgeon is a terrible instrument. Especially during operations on the eye. For example: after cutting the retina with a scalpel, the latter is covered with a scalpel. Because of this, the radius of the scalpel tip increases ten times - instead of 30 microns (1 micron = 0.001 mm) it becomes 300 microns. Making a cut in the cornea with such a scalpel means injuring it. Throwing away this scalpel and getting a new one is expensive. How to clean the scalpel from tightly attached microfilm and use the scalpel in the next operation?
