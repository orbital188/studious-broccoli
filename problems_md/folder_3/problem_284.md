# Problem 284. Chess players' bet 

The famous chess player Johann Zukertort (1842 – 1888), one of the three strongest chess players in the world of his time, made a bet with two other chess players (Steinitz and Blackburne), who were stronger than him, that he would perform a simultaneous blindfold game with them, scoring no less than one point. Zukertort won the bet, but thanks not to his chess skill, but to his own ingenuity. How did he succeed? Source: Creative association “Flight of Thought” (Chelyabinsk)
