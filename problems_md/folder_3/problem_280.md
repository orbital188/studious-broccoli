# Problem 280. “Cleaning the hot gas filter from dust”

It is necessary to clean hot exhaust (at temperatures up to 500°C) corrosive gases from non-magnetic dust - for example, flue gases from a cement kiln. For this purpose, filters made of multilayer metal fabric are used. But when the filter becomes clogged with dust, it has to be changed and processed for a long time to clean it: it is very difficult to remove dust from the pores of the fabric.
