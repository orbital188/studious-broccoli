# Problem 267. “Pressure welding”

Water flows in a pipe under high pressure. But a hole appeared through which a stream flows. The hole needs to be repaired, but for production reasons the line cannot be disconnected. The patch is welded under high water pressure. The welding proceeds normally until it reaches the very last section of the weld. When they try to weld it, the pressure jet “blows out” the molten metal and nothing happens. What to do? Source: Creative association “Flight of Thought” (Chelyabinsk)
