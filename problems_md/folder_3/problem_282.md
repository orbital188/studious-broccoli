# Problem 282. “Method of obtaining platinum fluoride”

Platinum metal reacts with fluorine gas to form volatile platinum hexafluoride at temperatures above 200°C.  However, for such a temperature it is almost impossible to select a material for the reactor chamber (equipment), because  under these conditions, fluorine quickly destroys any materials. It is necessary to ensure long-term operation of the equipment without significantly complicating it and increasing its cost. For example, so that the reaction occurs at a very low temperature. But at low temperatures, platinum does not interact with fluorine, in particular because platinum fluoride, which is slightly volatile, is formed very slowly. What to do?
