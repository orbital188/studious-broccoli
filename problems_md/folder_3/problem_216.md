# Problem 216. “Method of soldering coil wires”

There are polystyrene coils with thin insulated wire and metal legs.  When soldering the ends of the wires to the legs, they are dipped into a bath of solder, which is heated to 280°C. But first you need to strip the ends of the wire from insulation.  To increase labor productivity, it was proposed to increase the solder temperature to 380°C. In this case, the insulation of the wires burns, and tinning of the ends of the wire immediately occurs. However, at this temperature, the legs overheat, the coils warp and often become defective.
