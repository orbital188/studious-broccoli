# Problem 227. “Open package”

Sometimes it's hard to open a new grocery bag. Especially if it is made of thin polyethylene film. You can often see a picture where the seller either blows on the joint or frantically rubs the bag at the junction of the two sides of the bag. It’s good if you need to open one bag, but what if you have to open hundreds, thousands of plastic bags per day? Suggest a way to quickly and efficiently open plastic bags?
