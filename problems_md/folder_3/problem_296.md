# Problem 296. “Strange convolute”

The convolute worm lives in the Mediterranean Sea. It has single-celled algae living under its skin. The convolute has neither a stomach nor intestines. But the worm needs to be in the sun more often. When the tide goes out, millions of convolutes crawl out of their holes and sunbathe. And when the tide waves flood the beach, the worms burrow back into the sand. Explain the features of the worm's structure and behavior, taking into account the resources listed in the problem statement.
