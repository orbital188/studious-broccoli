# Problem 228. Temporary plug

To temporarily block a water pipe, a fast-hardening polymer composition is injected into the pipe opening under pressure. As a result, a plug is formed. This composition, being liquid, has time to spread along the pipe before hardening. In order for the plug to be tight, a lot of composition has to be supplied. However, the plug then turns out to be too long - then it is difficult to remove it from the pipe. How to effectively distribute the quantities of polymer composition for the plug? Source: Coll. KRIZ - CNTI, 1992, p. 60.
