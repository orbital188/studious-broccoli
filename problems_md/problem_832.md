# Problem 1050. “Do we divide fraternally or equally?”

In 1945, at the Potsdam Conference of the three powers of the anti-Hitler coalition, the Soviet delegation raised the issue of annexing the territory of Western Ukraine to the USSR. The Polish delegation vigorously protested against this. At the same time, the Poles referred to history: Lviv never belonged to Russia. How did Stalin respond to such a “historical” argument from the Poles?
