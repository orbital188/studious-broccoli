# Problem 1261. The Cheater Voivode

The governor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Karol Radziwill, nicknamed Pane-Kokhanku, was distinguished by his extravagant behavior. Once he arranged a luxurious reception for noble Polish and Lithuanian nobles in his castle in Nesvizh. Naturally, they were served by many courtyard servants. Among other entertainments, Pane-Kohanku invited guests to play billiards in a special room. By order of the governor, the floor in the room was made to sway slightly from side to side. It was completely invisible to those present, but enough to deflect a targeted shot at the billiard ball. Naturally, every time the owner took up the cue, he won the game. How did Pane-Kokhanko manage to do this?
