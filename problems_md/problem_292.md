# Problem 368. “The Conductor’s Fury”

Conductors, as a rule, are creative people. And often, tyrants. Conductor Arturo Toscanini sometimes flew into a rage during rehearsals if one of the orchestra members made a mistake. Once the artist falsified, and he had to make only a single sound. Toscanini scolded him and ordered him to start all over again. When the orchestra finished playing to that point, the unfortunate musician, getting excited, again touched the wrong string. The great conductor, suffocated with anger, broke his baton and ran out of the hall. How to be? Surely this can happen at a concert?
