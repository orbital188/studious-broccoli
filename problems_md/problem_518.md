# Problem 649. “Duel between Ivanushka and Koshchei”

In the forest, ten sources of dead water come out of the ground: from No. 1 to No. 10. From the first nine springs, anyone can take dead water, but source No. 10 is located in Koshchei’s cave, which no one except Koshchei himself can get into. The taste and color of dead water is no different from ordinary water, however, if a person drinks it, he will die. Only one thing can save him: if he drinks poison from a source whose number is higher. And if he immediately drinks the tenth poison, then nothing will help him. Ivanushka challenged Koshchei to a duel. The conditions of the duel were as follows: everyone brings a mug with liquid and gives it to their opponent to drink. Koschey was delighted: “Hurray! I will give poison No. 10, and Ivanushka will not be able to escape! And I myself will drink the poison that Ivanushka will bring me, I will wash it down with my tenth and I will be saved!” On the appointed day, the opponents met. Both honestly exchanged mugs and drank what was in them. However, it turned out that Koschei died, but Ivanushka remained alive. How did Ivanushka manage to defeat Koschei?
