# Problem 1239. Between two borders

In 1998, the governments of Belgium and the Netherlands decided to clarify the border between their states. Right on the border line was the small village of Barle, divided between the two countries. At the same time, in some places the state border did not pass through the streets of the village, but directly through the territory where houses were built. The question arose as to which state such houses should be attributed to. How did you resolve the problem?
