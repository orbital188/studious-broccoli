# Problem 1007. Balakirev and Peter I 

Once Peter the Great was so angry with Balakirev that he drove him not only out of sight, but out of his fatherland and with instructions not to appear “on my land.” Balakirev obeyed, and he was not seen for a long time. After a long time, Peter, sitting by the window, suddenly sees that Balakirev and his wife are riding in their one-wheeled carriage past his very windows. The Emperor, remembering him, became angry for disobedience and, jumping out onto porch, shouted: “Who allowed you, scoundrel, to violate my decree and show up on my land again?” How should Balakirev do the “right” thing?
