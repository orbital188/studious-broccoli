# Problem 923. “Associated gas”

Almost all oil fields used to have fiery flares burning associated gas. On the one hand, it is fire and explosion hazardous, it had to be removed somewhere, on the other hand, there was little of it, and there was no point in building special gas pipelines. Suggest a profitable way to transport associated gas.
