# Problem 1075. “Natural barometer”

In the small village of Serslev in Denmark there is a deep well. Village residents have long noticed that the air inside the well does not stand still, but circulates at different speeds - depending on the weather condition. These observations allowed the villagers to build a primitive barometer on the site of the well, which notifies that the weather will change in the near future. How did they do this?
