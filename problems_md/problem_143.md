# Problem 183. Walrus hunt 

The life of Pomors is closely connected with walrus hunting. Hunters usually sneak up to a pasture from the sea and unexpectedly attack. But a problem arose: even an animal mortally wounded by a harpoon often went into the sea, and there it died and drowned. This means that the hunters were left with nothing... It was impossible to keep the mighty animal on the shore. The Pomors found a way out of the situation - what do you suggest?
