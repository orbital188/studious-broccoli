# Problem 358. “Sell coins”

Under Napoleon I, new five-franc coins were issued. But they were unusually large and therefore the population did not want to use them. One can understand the officials' disappointment. They tried, hoping that the population would buy the coins. You see, it’s inconvenient for them...What do you advise the financial authorities of France who find themselves in such a situation?
