# Problem 797. “About turbulence”

Recently, a wind speed and direction sensor was installed on the roof of a building, but due to the turbulence that occurs above the roof, the readings are becoming unreliable. As the wind increases, the situation becomes even worse due to increasing turbulence and the sensor stops working altogether.  You can increase the length of the pipe on which the sensor is installed, thereby removing it from the turbulence zone; in this case, the pipe must be long enough, and the likelihood of a lightning strike increases, and the appearance loses its aesthetics. It is not possible to move the sensor from the roof to another location. How can you get out of this situation?
