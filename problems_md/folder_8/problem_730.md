# Problem 730. “Walking Hams”

During the time of Tsarist Russia, the legs of gray geese of the Tula breed were highly valued in Europe. Geese were then delivered to Europe for slaughter under their own power - the peasants simply drove the flock along a “long road.” There was only one thing that made it difficult to move: the geese’s paws were too soft, they were straying from the long journey. The presentation of the product has deteriorated. What can be done to protect the feet of geese during multi-day treks?
