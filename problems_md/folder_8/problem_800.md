# Problem 800. Gluttonous Harvester 

Before releasing agricultural machinery into the field, it is necessary to conduct bench tests. But the KSK-100 combine has a cutting drum with a productivity of 100 tons per hour, and the duration of continuous testing is several days. You can’t bring that much grass to the stand. Usually, in tests, leather waste was used instead of herbal mass, but there was nowhere to get it in such quantities. We tried using polymer “pasta”. After cutting, they can be restored in special extruder installations. But no installation can keep up with the shredder. What materials would you suggest using?
