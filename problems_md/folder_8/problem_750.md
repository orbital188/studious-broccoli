# Problem 750. “Evaluation of paintings”

Valuation of a work of art in monetary terms is still a rather subjective matter. This cannot be done without the participation of specially trained art historians. In Spain at the beginning of the 19th century, during the time of Francisco Goya, there were no such people at all. And yet, Madrid street vendors developed a criterion by which to evaluate paintings. How did they do it?
