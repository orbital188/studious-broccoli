# Problem 795. “Isn’t the tower sagging?”

There is an ancient tower in the center of the city. There was concern that the soil under its foundation was subsiding. We need to check whether the tower really goes down. But the closest point about which we can reliably say that it is not subsiding is located half a kilometer from the tower and is blocked by other buildings. What is the simplest way to check whether a tower is settling? Source(s): G. Altshuller. Find an idea. Novosibirsk, Nauka, 1991, p.157-8
