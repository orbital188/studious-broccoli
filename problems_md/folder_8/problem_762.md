# Problem 762. Mood of light

Light in cinema is one of the most powerful means of expression. Depending on the lighting of the hero, you can convey his desired state. Special lamps and spotlights illuminate the actors during filming. They are installed by lighting directors according to a special plan, thought out in advance by the director of the film. What would you suggest doing if you needed to show the hero’s mood changes? Or changes in the viewer’s perception of it?
