# Problem 756. Children of Lieutenant Schmidt

Once upon a time, such a thing happened in the USA. One millionaire, dying, bequeathed his fortune to his son, whom he had not seen for many years. Two people presented their rights to the inheritance, both with credible documents. To find out which of the two was the real heir, they found a pediatrician who had treated the son of a millionaire many years ago. He could not indicate the real heir, but one fact still helped him to do this. The surviving medical record indicated that the boy suffered from smallpox as a child. Based on this information, how can a doctor determine the real son?
