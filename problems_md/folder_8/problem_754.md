# Problem 754. Pavlovsk Palace 

Emperor Paul I hated his ancestor, Peter I. To emphasize the absence of any connection between them, Paul did not want to live in the Winter Palace, but ordered a new residence to be built for himself. Brought up on classical ancient culture, Paul dreamed of the glory of the generals and rulers of Ancient Rome. Paul wanted to show the continuity of his military glory from the ancient Roman triumphs in the new building. This should have been felt from afar, already upon approaching the palace. How to show this?
