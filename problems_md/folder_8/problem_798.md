# Problem 798. “Budinny against the Basmachi”

In the 1920s, cavalryman and Red commander Semyon Budyonny suppressed the Basmach rebellions in Turkestan. The Basmachi often operated at night. And early in the morning, Budyonny’s detachment entered the village, and the army commander personally examined all the men and teenagers lined up. How did Budyonny determine which of the men was a Basmach? Source(s): B. Bochshtein. Entertaining Kremlinology. M, Stage, 1991, p.
