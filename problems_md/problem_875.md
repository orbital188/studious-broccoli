# Problem 1101. “Honey is not for bears”

In ancient times, beekeeping was widely developed in Rus' - breeding bees in tree hollows. The hollows in which the honeycombs were placed could be natural or they could be specially hollowed out in a powerful wide trunk. Borti - that's what the hollows with bees were called - were high above the ground, and getting to them was not so easy. However, there was one animal in Russian forests that managed to feast on honey from such natural storehouses by climbing trees. This bear is the one who knows where the honey is. But ancient Russian beekeepers learned to protect their forest hives from bears. How did they do it?
