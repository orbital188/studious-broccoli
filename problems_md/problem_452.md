# Problem 578. Methane in mines 

There are many devices for monitoring the content of explosive methane (CH4) in the atmosphere of mines and mine workings. From live canaries to sophisticated electronic devices that respond to changes in the electrical and thermal conductivity of the air, variations in its chemical composition, etc. The problem, however, is that the above parameters are significantly affected by dustiness and fluctuations in temperature and humidity, which are inevitable in mines. As a result, the reliability of the devices decreases, and false alarms are not uncommon. Suggest ways to monitor the methane content in mines. What to do? Source: Coll. RTEZ 1999, Publ.
