# Problem 300. “Water lilies on the pond”

One water lily floats on the surface of the pond, which is constantly dividing and growing. Thus, every day the area occupied by water lilies doubles. After a month, the entire surface of the pond is covered. How long will it take for the entire surface of the pond to be covered with water lilies, if initially two water lilies float on the surface?
