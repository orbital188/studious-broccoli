# Problem 643. “Ultraviolet irradiation”

There is a serious problem in combating the spread of skin cancer, the most dangerous of all the consequences of increased ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Thus, in some areas of the United States and Europe, the incidence of skin cancer has skyrocketed recently. Experts explain this by a change in the lifestyle of people who began to spend more time in the sun and spend more time naked on the southern beaches. Doctors' recommendations like: “On the first day, sunbathe for no more than 5 minutes, on the second - 10 minutes...” are ineffective.  How to convey to a person information about the total dose of UV radiation received per day in an extremely simple and cheap way?
