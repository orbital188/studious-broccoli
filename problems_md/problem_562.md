# Problem 710. “How to sculpture an angel?”

Jainism is one of the most interesting religions in India. One of the concepts of Jainism is guardian spirits, the so-called BAIROBI - ethereal, incorporeal, formless beings. A Jain temple should have sculptures of bairobi. And such that you can immediately tell that these are perfumes. Usually in such cases the figure of the spirit becomes humanoid. This gives high recognition (compare with Christian images of angels, in theory, equally incorporeal). But bairobis, unlike angels, are formless. How to make a bairobi sculpture?
