# Problem 415. “Rothschild and Baku Oil”

By the end of the 19th century, the development of the oil industry in Russia required a lot of funds. Drilling a well for 100 fathoms cost a huge amount of money at that time - as much as 10 thousand rubles. Where could I get them? There were no government subsidies then. The loan was expensive. And in the mid-80s of the last century, the Western European entrepreneur and financier Rothschild appeared for the first time. He offers Baku oil industrialists loans on fabulously easy terms - only 3% per annum, although all loans at that time were given at a higher interest rate. Agree, Rothschild knew how to count and make a profit. Why did he offer loans at 3% per annum?
