# Problem 658. Date palm 

Date palms are the main natural raw material for making palm sugar. It is made from the sap of date palms. To extract the juice, you need to make a deep cut under the very crown of an adult tree. But date palms grow up to 20 m tall, and getting to the crown along a smooth trunk is very problematic. What can you do to easily reach the top of the palm tree?
