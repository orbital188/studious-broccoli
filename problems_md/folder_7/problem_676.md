# Problem 676. Wooden houses 

Wooden houses are built from dry wood, otherwise the house will not last long. In addition, the wood is impregnated with resin for strength. This takes a long time. But in Siberia, wooden houses last for decades, and the summer, when the wood can be dried well, is short. How do Siberians manage to build “long-term” wooden houses? Source: Graubin G.
