# Problem 672. “Injecting water into a well”

An auxiliary well is drilled next to the production well and water is pumped into it, which displaces the remaining oil from the depths.  The remaining oil is more viscous than the oil that has already been pumped out - it is firmly adhered to underground rocks. It is known that oil recovery from wells does not exceed 40%. How to enhance the effect of displacing oil from the depths? Source: Sat. RTEZ 1999, Ed. ChuvSU, s. 94.
