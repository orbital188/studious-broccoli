# Problem 618. Artesian well 

An artesian well serves at full capacity for no more than 15 years: the filters become clogged, most of the surrounding aquifers become clogged, and the pipes become overgrown with rust. The well can be revived with hydrochloric acid.Â  It dissolves ferruginous and carbonate compounds well, which are deposited on reinforcement from groundwater. But acid is a dangerous thing. We need containers made of acid-resistant materials; this is difficult and economically unprofitable. How to destroy sediments that have clogged the filter and surrounding soil? Source: Sat.
