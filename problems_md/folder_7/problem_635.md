# Problem 635. “Heating oil”

At oil refineries, the primary heating of oil is carried out in tubular coils, which are heated from the outside by a number of flare nozzles. To increase the productivity of the installation, the torch of the burners was increased. A large flame began to touch the surface of the pipes, areas of local overheating appeared, which led to burning of the oil. I had to turn down the torch, but then the oil did not have time to warm up. How to increase the torch while avoiding direct contact of the flame with the surface of the pipe? Source: Sat.
