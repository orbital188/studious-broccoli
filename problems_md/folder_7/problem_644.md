# Problem 644. “Snow on the wires”

In winter, wet snow flakes on power lines. With the onset of warmth, it thaws, and if frost strikes again, it turns into ice. A layer of ice may build up. Wires stretch under unbearable weight and may break. To combat such icing, rings made of ferrite, a material with magnetic properties, were placed on the wires every 5-6 meters. Under the influence of alternating current passing through the wires, the magnet heats up. But the rings are constantly heated - both in winter and in summer. And these are unnecessary losses of electricity. How to “turn off” ferrite rings for the summer?
