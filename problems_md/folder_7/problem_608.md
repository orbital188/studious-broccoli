# Problem 608. “Secrets of the Atamansha”

Once upon a time, Atamansha lived in the forest with her forest robbers. One day she was sitting in her cave with her assistant and drinking tea. Suddenly there was a knock on the door, and an evil royal adviser came in. “I have secret and urgent business with you,” said the adviser. “It’s just necessary that no one knows about him except the two of us.” The Atamansha kicked the assistant out of the cave and, on pain of death, forbade him to eavesdrop. What should the assistant do when he really wants to know about a secret matter, but is afraid to eavesdrop - the Atamansha is having a conversation with disobedient short?
