# Problem 674. “War or Peace?”

The Philippines is an island state, which, due to its convenient location, has been a “tidbit” for invaders throughout history. Throughout history, the islands were owned by Spain, the USA, and Japan. The local population, even after state self-determination at the end of the 19th century, was constantly in a state of either war or peace. But how can the government notify the country’s residents who live on islands scattered in the ocean about this if the means of communication are very poorly developed?
