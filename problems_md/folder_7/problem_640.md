# Problem 640. “Volume of wood”

Pine logs were loaded into open railway cars. To determine the volume of wood loaded, inspectors measured the diameter of each trunk. The work is painstaking and slow. And the train is idle at this time. Suggest how to quickly measure the volume of all wood without delaying the train?
