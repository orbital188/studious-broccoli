# Problem 647. “Treatment of wastewater from fluoride”

The method used in art glass factories to purify wastewater from fluorine by precipitating it in the form of slightly soluble calcium fluoride does not guarantee a sufficient degree of purification. CaF2 still dissolves in water, and the concentration of fluoride ions turns out to be several times higher than the maximum permissible concentration. Because of this, the wastewater has to be diluted with a large volume of clean water. How can you get rid of this problem? Source: Sat. RTEZ 1999, Ed. ChuvSU, s. 93
