# Problem 612. “The ship must arrive on time”

The English traveler Phileas Fogg and his servant Passepartout cannot get to England on time - there is no passing ship. And if they are late, they will lose an important argument and a lot of money. Fogg had to hire a beautiful steamer with wooden superstructures and, without a moment’s delay, set sail. It was already within easy reach of England, but, as luck would have it, the ship ran out of coal - and the steamship engines stopped. What to do? Where can I get fuel at sea?
