# Problem 683. “The Butcher vs. the Count”

In the 18th century in England, in the town of Brighton, there lived a butcher named Bullock, who was very fat. Not far from the town was the estate of Earl Barrmore, who was a young brilliant aristocrat and also fond of athletics. And then one day the fat butcher offered the count a bet: he would overtake the count in the 100-meter race, provided that he himself chose the place of the competition and the count would give him a head start of 35 meters. The bet amount was very impressive! And the fat man won. How did he do it?
