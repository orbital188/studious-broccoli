# Problem 671. “Where did the ruble go?”

Three people paid 30 rubles for lunch - 10 rubles each. After the visitors left, the owner of the cafe discovered that lunch cost not 30, but 25 rubles. She sent the boy with 5 rubles in pursuit. Each of the visitors took a ruble for themselves. They left 2 rubles for the boy. It turns out that each paid not 10, but 9 rubles. There were three visitors: 3 x 9 = 27. The boy had another 2 rubles. 27+2 = 29. But three people paid 30 rubles for lunch. Where did the ruble go?
