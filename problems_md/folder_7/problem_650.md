# Problem 650. “Cleaning car exhaust gases”

Half of the air pollution in cities comes from car exhaust gases: hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide (2), lead oxides, etc. The main part of them are products of incomplete combustion of gasoline. There is an expensive method of burning them on platinum catalysts. Due to its high cost, this method is rarely used. The afterburning method has one more drawback: the heat released is not used to increase the power of the gasoline engine - the heat is dissipated. What can be done to solve this problem?Source: Sat.
