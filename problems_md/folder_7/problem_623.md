# Problem 623. “Let’s help microorganisms”

Not too polluted water is capable of self-purification. Aquatic microorganisms that can oxidize petroleum products play an important role in this process. Sometimes, to purify water from organic contaminants, specially grown yeast bacteria are introduced into it. But introducing “clean” microorganisms into water is very inconvenient: they are distributed unevenly over the surface and are carried away by the wind. What to do? Source: Sat. RTEZ 1999, Ed.
