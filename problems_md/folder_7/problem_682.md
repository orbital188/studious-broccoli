# Problem 682. “Death to parasites!”

In 1991, a very rare infection, Lyme disease, suddenly began to spread with unexpected speed in a number of areas of the United States.  Long-term conservation regulations, which had a beneficial effect on the fauna, led to an increase in the number of mice. Only among them was this disease noticed before. The abundance of mice led to the proliferation of ticks that carry the disease. And thanks to the massive spread of tourism, ticks began to bite people more often.  Come up with a method of tick control that is completely satisfactory to the Humane Society. Moreover, it would be nice if the mice themselves destroyed the ticks. Source: Sat. RTEZ 1999, Ed. ChuvSU, s. 96.
