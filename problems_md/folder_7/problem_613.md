# Problem 613. “Catalysts and dust”

In the end, any poisonous gas emitted by the pipes of chemical and metallurgical plants ceases to be poisonous. True, before this happens, he manages to do a lot of trouble, so they try to speed up the disinfecting reactions. To do this, grates or meshes coated with catalysts are installed in the gas ducts. At metallurgical plants, in order to prevent dust from damaging the catalysts, they install cyclones, based on the separation of dust by the action of centrifugal forces in the gas flow, and then catalysts. Expensive and inconvenient. What to do? Source: Sat. RTEZ 1999, Ed. ChuvSU, s. 50.
