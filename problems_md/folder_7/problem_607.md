# Problem 607. The Lion and the Mule

In a beautiful green valley, a Mule was peacefully nibbling grass. And suddenly I saw a lurking Leo. “Hey, I see you!” - shouted the Mule. - What are you doing here, in my valley? - This is my valley! - the Lion growled in surprise, not expecting such impudence. And the Mule at that time was thinking how he could escape. It would be good to force the Lion to come up from behind, then you can hit him with your hooves. Mules have very strong hind legs. While Leo comes to his senses, you can run away. But how can you force Leo to come up from behind, right under his hooves?
