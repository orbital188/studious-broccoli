# Problem 1341. “Bald to the touch”

An elderly, modest employee with no hair on his head worked in one institution. His bald spot was a constant source of jokes for his young, cheerful colleagues. One day one of them crept up to the elderly man from behind, stroked his bald head and, turning to his comrades, cheerfully said: “Wow! It feels exactly like my wife’s butt!” He also stroked his bald head and answered the young man in such a way that all jokes about his bald head stopped in the future. How did an elderly employee with a bald head “parry” a colleague’s joke?
