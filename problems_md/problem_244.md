# Problem 308. “Stop the fire”

How to quickly block off a burning drift in a mine with sandbags? The bags are stored in a niche in the place where you need to make a partition in case of a fire. If you throw the bags quickly, the mine rescuers will have time to build a wall, but the fire flames will pass through the holes in the wall. If the bags are laid out well and carefully, then the flames will not pass through the wall, but the rescuers will not have time to lay out the wall and will fall into the flames of the fire. How to build a wall quickly and without holes, or by folding a wall with holes to close them very quickly? Source: Sat. CRISIS - CNTI, 1992, p. 102.
