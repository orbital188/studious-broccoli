# Problem 117. Invisible pedestrian

On Friday evening, one person walked several kilometers across Moscow from the Kremlin to the zoo and saw no one. Moscow was full of people, but no one saw him. The day was sunny and clear. The man had good eyesight and saw where he was going. At the same time, he walked all the time. How could this happen?
