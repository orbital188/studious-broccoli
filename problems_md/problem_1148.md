# Problem 1390. “Reading hieroglyphs”

The ancient Egyptians wrote in hieroglyphs, which looked like a kind of pictograms and depicted mountains, the sun, water, people, birds, animals, etc. In this case, the hieroglyphs were arranged both in a column vertically and in a line horizontally. Vertical inscriptions were always read from top to bottom, but horizontal inscriptions could be read both from right to left and from left to right. How did the ancient Egyptians determine which direction to read a hieroglyphic inscription?
