# Problem 1253. “Diagnostics of corrosion at a distance”

Corrosion is the most “dangerous disease” of metal. It begins to develop when the surface of the metal enters into a chemical reaction with the liquid. To detect the onset of this reaction, direct contact of the (usually chemical) indicator with the metal is necessary. This is not always convenient. How to determine the onset of corrosion without even touching the metal surface?
