# Problem 403. “Is the wastewater clean?”

Wastewater from workshops using chemical technologies is very dangerous for wildlife. The plant went to the expense of installing filters that clean wastewater well. But the local community still does not want to believe in the purity of the wastewater, despite the plant’s informational efforts. How can a plant prove that it is right?
