# Problem 460. “Lawyer”

Mid-20s of our century. Solovetsky special purpose camp. A group of criminals plays cards. One of them loses two fingers of his hand. The laws here are cruel - you can’t cut it off - you’re a pariah, an outcast, worse than a slave, cut it off - you’re a criminal, a “self-cutter”, and this is six months of “axe”, a terrible isolation cell, hard labor in hard labor, from which you rarely return. A former lawyer ends up in a cell, performs in as the defender of the loser and wins the “trial”. His arguments?
