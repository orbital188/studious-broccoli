# Problem 1419. I feel sorry for the bird

In the 18th century, the Italian illusionist Pinetti performed a canary trick on audiences. He took a live bird out of the cage, played with it, and then gave it to one of the spectators to hold. The canary instantly died in the wrong hands, which invariably caused strong emotions among the public. The magician took the dead bird and placed it on the table under a glass cover. The canary came to life and soared under the circus dome. How did the magician manage to first kill and then revive the canary?
