# Problem 641. “Lonely man”

A man lived alone in his house for two months. No one visited him and he never went outside. At the end of those two months, the man went crazy. One night, he put out the fire, turned off the lights and left the house. No one saw him again. Because he left that house, 90 people died. Why did they die?
