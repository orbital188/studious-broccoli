# Problem 195. Nimble dinosaur 

Scientists are working to restore the supersaurus, a giant even among dinosaurs. Its pelvic bones, discovered in Colorado (USA), are about 1.8 m long and about 1.2 m wide. Paleontologists believe that the supersaurus weighed about 39 tons, was 40 meters long and over 12 meters high. Design bones, such as the femurs, of the supersaurus. They must withstand its weight and dynamic loads when the supersaurus moves - after all, the dinosaur must move fast enough to get food and must be light - otherwise the supersaurus would be several tons heavier.
