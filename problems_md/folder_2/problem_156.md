# Problem 156. “The lamp disappears from the palace”

In “The Tale of Ala ad-Din and the Magic Lamp” from the fairy tales “1001 Nights,” an evil Maghreb (resident of the fabulous city of Maghreb) decided to steal from Ala ad-Din a magic lamp in which the almighty genie lives. He “told fortunes in the sand to see where the lamp was, and he saw that the lamp was in the palace, and not at Ala ad-Din’s.” However, no one knows about its magical properties. How can a Maghreb citizen take what he wants from the palace?
