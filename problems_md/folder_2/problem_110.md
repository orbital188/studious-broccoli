# Problem 110. “The Bedouin problem. Where can I get a man?”

The birth of a son is a real holiday for Bedouins. In honor of this event, a sheep is supposed to be slaughtered and a feast is held. However, if the child’s father is away at that moment, then there is no one to slaughter the sheep - this is a purely male matter, a woman has no right to do this. It is also indecent to turn to other men for help. How to slaughter a sheep?
