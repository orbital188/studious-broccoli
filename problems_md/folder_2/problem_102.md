# Problem 102. “Did you order a fight?”

Scientists observed lizards kept in captivity in a terrarium. It has been noticed that there are frequent fights between males for leadership. And, ultimately, one lizard becomes a leader, the other a “subordinate.” Scientists decided to check: 1. What will happen if the leader and subordinate are switched?2. How will lizards behave if they are not given the opportunity to fight for a long time? The problem, first of all, is how to provide “conditions” so that: - lizards “swap” places in the hierarchy - for the first type of experiments; - lizards do not fight - for the second type experiments. How to create such “conditions”?
