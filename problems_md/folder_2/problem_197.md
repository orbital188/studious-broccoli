# Problem 197. Fish must swim

When live fish are transported in tanks, due to overcrowding, many fish die. It has been proven that if you force the fish to move actively, losses are reduced several times. But how to do that? All kinds of pumps, mixers and similar units built into tanks only increase the cost of the design and harm the fish, but do not give the desired effect. Suggest your options: how to make fish in tanks move? Source: Creative association “Flight of Thought” (Chelyabinsk)
