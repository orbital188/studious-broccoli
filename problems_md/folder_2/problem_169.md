# Problem 169. “Worms and... clean hands”

The best bait for fishing in summer is a worm. When fishing, worms are usually brought in wooden boxes or jars. The worms burrow into the ground and, in order to get one of them, you have to tear up the ground, getting your hands dirty in the process. Suggest an idea for designing a container to hold worms so you can pick them up without getting your hands dirty.
