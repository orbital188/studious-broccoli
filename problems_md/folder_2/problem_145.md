# Problem 145. “Touch gently”

Many admired how beautifully the plane landed. He touched down on the runway, and suddenly a plume of gray haze followed him! Fire? No! Haze appears when the rubber of the tires comes into contact with the concrete surface of the runway. And such “touch” leads to premature wear of the wheels. If only they could be extended their service life, the airline would save some money. What to do? Of course, the solution immediately comes to mind - install a motor that will spin the wheel. However, such a decision will lead to an increase in the weight of the aircraft, which is not good. And, in addition, the plane lands at different speeds, but the speed of the wheel from the engine is constant, i.e. the speeds of the wheel and the plane in this case are not completely consistent. What should I do?
