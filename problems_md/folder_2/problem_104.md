# Problem 104. “Take everything out”

The management of the very old, prestigious and expensive Atrium Hotel in Darwin (Australia) decided to completely renovate and refurbish its rooms. To do this, it was necessary first of all and in a short time to get rid of everything that was in the rooms: beds, televisions, tables, chairs, paintings, linen and towels, equipment from the bathrooms and everything that was not firmly attached to the walls . But it turned out that the cost estimate for the repair and refurbishment of the hotel rooms did not include money for “cleaning.” Still, a solution was found! Moreover, an additional positive PR effect was obtained. What do you suggest?
