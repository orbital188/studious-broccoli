# Problem 192. “How to remove the ball?”

A ball is pressed into the leg of the precision measurement indicator.  As you work, the working surface wears out.  You need to take out the ball and turn it a little, without damaging other points on the surface... But how to do this? Source: Sat. CRISIS - CNTI, 1992, p. 58
