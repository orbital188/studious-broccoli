# Problem 198. “Refugee snakes”

Sometimes snakes are relocated. That is, they take it from the terrarium into some kind of box and transport it. One day it happened that there were no snake specialists. But poisonous snakes need to be moved from one box to another, and they don’t want to move. What should I do?
