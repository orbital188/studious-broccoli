# Problem 184. “Cleaning pipes from sludge”

The pipes of water intake systems become clogged with silt. How to clean them? You can periodically partially disassemble the system for cleaning, but this is an extra expense. You can wash away the silt with a strong stream of water, but its consumption is high. You can drive cleaning urchins into the pipes, but where is the guarantee that they will not get stuck in silted areas. It is necessary to find a cleaner that will disappear from the pipe after cleaning.
