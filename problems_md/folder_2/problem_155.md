# Problem 155. “Curiosity is not a vice”

In “The Story of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves” from the fairy tales “1001 Nights,” Ali Baba, who was very poor, suddenly got a lot of gold coins in bags. He was going to simply bury them in the ground, but his wife wanted to count how much money they had received. I started counting one coin at a time, but there was too much gold. Then she decided to weigh the gold, and since there were no scales in the house, she asked a neighbor for scales. “Ali Baba’s wife is poor, and she does not have the habit of measuring anything. I should see what kind of grain she has today, that she suddenly needed some measure,” thought the neighbor. How can she quietly satisfy her curiosity?
