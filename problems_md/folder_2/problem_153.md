# Problem 153. “Lure out the bee”

Tetramorim caespitum ants prey on galactic bees. But ants can't fly. Therefore, they choose those bees that guard the entrances to their burrows. The bee sits inside, and it is extremely difficult for the ants to get to it. Moreover, the bee does not want to leave its place. Now, if only I could lure the bee out! Then the ants would “be happy.” By the way, ants succeed in this. How?
