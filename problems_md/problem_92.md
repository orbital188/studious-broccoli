# Problem 119. Quiet setup

Piano tuners are endowed not only with hearing from God, but also with angelic patience. The tuner makes each of the three strings that make up the “mode” sound at least three times—higher, lower, and “exactly.” For the neighbors of the owner of the instrument, this means many hours of torment. How nice it would be if the adjusters didn’t “strain the ears” of the owners and neighbors. What to do?
