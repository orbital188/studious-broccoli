# Problem 1159. “Your own auto mechanic”

In the UK in the 1960s, all car manufacturers paid a sales tax to the government on the sale of each car they built. At the same time, the sale of the same car disassembled for spare parts was not subject to tax. The main and only condition was the absence of instructions for assembling the car. Lotus decided to take advantage of this chance to evade the tax and actually began selling the complete car in knocked down form. At the same time, buyers who were ready to assemble the car themselves still received the information necessary for this. How did Lotus instruct self-assemblers of its cars?
