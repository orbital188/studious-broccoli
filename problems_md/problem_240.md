# Problem 305. “Lure out the nematode”

Spring. Collective farmers are preparing potatoes for planting, but a pest, a nematode, has been lurking in the field since last year. They can wait in their cocoons for more than one year, and as soon as they smell the potato juice from the tubers damaged during planting, they will crawl out of the cocoons and get to the delicacy - potatoes. You can treat the fields with chemicals, but pests adapt to them. In addition, it is harmful to both people and animals. What should I do?
