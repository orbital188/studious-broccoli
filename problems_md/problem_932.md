# Problem 1162. “House or road?”

In the early 1980s, the owners of a large plot of land in one of the districts of the Japanese city of Osaka decided to build a multi-story residential building on it. However, when filling out the documents, it turned out that according to the approved urban development plan, they do not have the right to do this, since this is where the expressway should pass. The landowners suggested that the corporation that built the road change the route, but the builders categorically refused to do so. And yet, after long negotiations, a compromise was found. How did businessmen manage to resolve the conflict?
