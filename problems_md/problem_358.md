# Problem 452. “Bottles with medicine”

Bottles of medicine were delivered to the pharmacy, each containing a thousand pills. It became known that, due to a pharmacist’s mistake, in one of the bottles each pill contained 10 mg of medication more than the permissible dose. How to identify a bottle with an increased dose of medication by just one weighing? Source: Creative association “Flight of Thought” (Chelyabinsk)
