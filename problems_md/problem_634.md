# Problem 803. “Baba Yaga bone leg”

Baba Yaga, as you know, has two legs: one is bone, the other is simple. On a simple leg, Baba Yaga moves at a speed of 6 km/h, and on a bone leg - twice as fast. From the hut on chicken legs to the nearest store is 36 km. How long will it take Baba Yaga to cover this distance?
