# Problem 1020. “Nowhere louder”

Ruslan drives up to the Head and wakes her up. The enraged Head opens its mouth and... Pushkin’s next words are: “But then a noisy voice was heard.” In the opera “Ruslan and Lyudmila,” “noisy voice” means that the Head’s part should sound much louder than Ruslan’s part. But in a duet, Ruslan also cannot sing quietly - he is angry at an unexpected obstacle, and his part must sound as loud as possible. How to show the “noisy voice” of the Head’s party?
