# Problem 1018. “Bare walls”

In medieval Chinese temples it was not allowed to paint walls, install sculptures, or introduce any decorations at all. The walls, floor, and ceiling of the temple had to be clean and bare. But people come to the temple to renounce their worries and find peace of mind. According to Eastern concepts, this can be done by contemplating beauty. Bare walls, devoid of any decorations, hardly contribute to this. But you can't break the rule. How can we ensure that temple visitors can still contemplate the beauty?
