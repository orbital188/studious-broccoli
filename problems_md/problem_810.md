# Problem 1023. “To each his own”

In the play “Choice” the main character is a talented artist, in whose paintings everyone sees something different. These pictures should be on stage. But no matter how you draw the pictures, there will be a specific image on them. How can we make sure that the audience of the performance also sees their own thing in the paintings?
