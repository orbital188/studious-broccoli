# Problem 604. Fox and Black Grouse 

The Fox runs through the forest and sees a black grouse sitting on a birch tree. She ran up to the tree and thought about how she could eat the Black Grouse. You just can’t get a bird on a birch tree. The Fox says: “Come down, Black Grouse, to the ground, let’s take a walk together.” Today, after all, a decree has been issued so that none of the animals should touch each other, but live in peace and harmony. How can Black Grouse check whether the Fox is telling the truth?
