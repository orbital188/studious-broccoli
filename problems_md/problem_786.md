# Problem 998. The Third Exit of the Criminal Rabbit

One day the Cat and the Rabbit agreed to take a walk together. They agreed that the Cat would come for the Rabbit and meet him at the exit. The rabbit lived in holes under the hill, from which the entire circle was clearly visible. Approaching, the Cat remembered that there were three exits from Ushastyâ€™s house. I completely forgot at which hole to wait for my friend. The rabbit can come out at any moment, not find anyone and be offended! What should the cat do?
