# Problem 1434. Speed ​​of a sailboat 

In the 15th century, sea sailing ships did not yet have precise stationary instruments that determined the speed of the ship. But sailors, knowing a simple formula for the dependence of speed on time and distance, learned to calculate the speed while the ship was moving under sail in the open ocean on calm water. How did they do it?
