# Problem 158. Condors? Get your things out! 

There was a time when there were only 5 California condors left on Earth. Why so few? Stupid because: they died in a collision with power line wires, they drank antifreeze by mistake and “fought” with technology in other ways... Are there not enough technical dangers in the world? So, there are only 5 California condors in the world. Just a little more and this species will disappear from the face of the Earth. Scientists suggested placing them in a safe place: not in a zoo, of course, but in a nearby nature reserve. However, it is extremely difficult to catch condors. How to be a scientist?
