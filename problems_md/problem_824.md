# Problem 1041. Hot spot under a skyscraper

In September 2013, the English press reported a rather remarkable phenomenon. In London's banking district, the glass-enclosed 37-story Walkie-Talkie skyscraper, which has a slightly concave shape, concentrates the sun's rays so that they are concentrated in one place on the opposite side of the street and strongly heat a small area of ​​​​the space. The sun's rays even melted the plastic body of an expensive car parked there. However, based on the London weather, this phenomenon occurs only a few weeks a year. How can we effectively turn this unexpected “harmful effect” into a benefit?
