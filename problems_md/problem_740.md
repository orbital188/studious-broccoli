# Problem 931. Chinese Temples

In medieval Chinese temples it was not allowed to paint walls, install sculptures, or introduce any decorations at all. The walls, floor, and ceiling of the temple had to be clean and bare. But people come to the temple to renounce their worries and find peace of mind. According to Eastern concepts, this can be done by contemplating beauty. This means that in a temple a person should have the opportunity to observe something beautiful from all sides. Bare walls, devoid of any decorations (including architectural, stucco, etc.) hardly suit visitors. But this rule cannot be broken. How can we ensure that temple visitors still see as much beauty as possible?
