# Problem 691. Crossing the bridge 

The border between Germany and Switzerland during World War II ran along a river in one place. A bridge was built across the river, on which a guard with a machine gun stood on the German side. The sentry was supposed to not let anyone out of German territory and send back those coming from Switzerland. Every three minutes, the sentry came out of his booth to inspect the fully visible bridge, which could be crossed in five to six minutes. But one person who needed to get to Switzerland still managed to get through the border. How did he do it?
