# Problem 412. “The way to a judge’s heart is through his stomach”

The partner filed a lawsuit against Pinhus. There was a trial coming up.
- What do you think, Mr. Lawyer, can I send the judge a goose as a gift?
- God forbid. This would be an attempt at bribery, and you will lose the case.
Pinchus won the case. And he said to the lawyer, smiling:
- I still sent the goose to the judge!
- Really? How then can we explain Pinchus’ victory?
