# Problem 899. “Who left behind in the ocean?”

Tanker captains quite often indulge in environmental poaching - dumping the remaining oil into the water after unloading and washing the holds. Oil spreads over the water in a thin film and destroys all living things around... It is very difficult to fight the film, it requires a lot of money. And who should pay for all this? Of course, tanker owners who make profits from transporting oil. When an accident occurs, it gets publicity and the defendant is found, but environmental poaching is more difficult to combat. How to find the “owner” of an oil spill?
