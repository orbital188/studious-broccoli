# Problem 1236. “Nike or Reebok?”

During the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, ​​Reebok sponsored the American basketball team. Michael Jordan, who was under contract to be the advertising “face” of Nike, played on the national team. The Americans became gold medalists at the Olympics, and, naturally, had to come out in full force for the awards. Jordon was faced with a dilemma. If he stands on the podium wearing a jersey with the Nike logo, his contract with team sponsor Reebok will be violated. If he wears the Reebok logo, he could be in trouble due to his individual contract with Nike. What should a famous basketball player do?
