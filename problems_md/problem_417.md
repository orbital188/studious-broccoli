# Problem 539. Budyonny in Lithuania 

The famous Budyonny once headed a diplomatic delegation to Lithuania before the Second World War. At the president's dinner, he suddenly washes down vodka with garlic water from a bowl placed in front of each participant in the diplomatic dinner. And in the bowl they usually washed their hands after eating chicken. The journalists present froze in anticipation of a sensation - there is an example of ignorance of ordinary etiquette. What should diplomats do? See. discussion of the problem in the forum
