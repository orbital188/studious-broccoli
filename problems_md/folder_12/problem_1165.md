# Problem 1165. “City without advertising”

In 2007, the authorities of the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo banned the use of any outdoor advertising in the urban environment. The law, naturally, hit the advertising business hard, but the administration, according to the townspeople, adopted it quite justifiably. How did the City Hall of Sao Paulo justify the ban on outdoor advertising?
