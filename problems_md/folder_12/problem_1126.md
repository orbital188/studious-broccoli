# Problem 1126. “Empty at sea”

Medieval merchants often transported their goods from one city to another by sea. Merchant ships were built to carry a lot of cargo. The loaded ship had good stability at sea. But if the merchant was unable to find goods for the return journey, the ship sailed empty, and in the open sea with a large wave there was a very real chance of capsizing. How did the owners of merchant ships get out of this situation?
