# Problem 1110. Customs does not give the go-ahead

One day, a box of identical-looking kegel balls – 12 pieces – arrived at customs for inspection before shipping abroad. The balls were plastic, although they weighed like wood. The customs officer suggested that there might be an empty space inside the balls in which contraband could be hidden. But the customs officer did not have any special equipment at hand to “enlighten” the balls. And yet, the customs officer managed to determine in which of the balls the jewelry was hidden. How did he do it?
