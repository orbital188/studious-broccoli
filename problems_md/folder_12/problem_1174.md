# Problem 1174. “Anti-fascist agitation”

In 2011, representatives of the German anti-fascist organization Exit-Deutschland decided to secretly hold a daring campaign event in the “den” of their opponents - at an ultra-right rock festival. In appearance, everything looked quite in the spirit of the event: T-shirts with the inscription “Hardcore Rebellen” were distributed free of charge to those who wished. How could anti-fascists agitate against far-right extremism in this way?
