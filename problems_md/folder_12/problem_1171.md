# Problem 1171. “They knew Jobs’ car by sight”

According to the law of the American state of California, when buying a new car, the owner must register the car within six months and get the appropriate license plate. Until then, you can drive without license plates. Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, who lives in California, took full advantage of this. He constantly drove a Mercedes-Benz SL 55 AMG without any license plates at all. How did Jobs manage it?
