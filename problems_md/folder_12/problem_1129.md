# Problem 1129. “About poisoned air”

Among other things, the Egyptians wanted to receive special equipment for detecting toxic substances in the air. Soviet intelligence officers offered them, instead of expensive, ultra-modern sensors at that time, a very simple and affordable way to determine the presence of toxic substances in a room. What kind of method is this?
