# Problem 1120. “Looking for a ball for golfers”

Golf is a fairly popular game among wealthy people in Europe and America. They play it on a large flat area. The players' task is to hit a small ball with a stick so that it hits a certain place. This does not happen right away, of course. And it often happens that the ball flies far beyond the playing field. And sometimes it gets completely lost somewhere. How can you help inexperienced golfers find their lost ball?
