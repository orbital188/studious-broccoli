# Problem 1119. “Battleship with a computer”

In the 1970s, a computer game appeared in the United States that simulated naval battles: a computer squadron fought with a player squadron, maneuvering across the seas and oceans. The computer squadron, as a rule, won by hitting all the enemy ships, and entered into the next battle with the player's new squadron. And in order for the computer ships, “worn” in previous battles, to still gain an advantage, the creators of the game prudently included a certain move in it. The computer squadron did it every time before a new battle. How did she create an advantage for herself?
