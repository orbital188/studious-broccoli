# Problem 1124. “Plane on skis”

In winter, on the fronts of the Great Patriotic War, planes often could not take off from a thick layer of snow. There was nothing to clear it with. One engineer recalled that earlier, when planes had non-retractable landing gear, the wheels were simply replaced with skis in winter. Quite a few of these skis have survived. But on planes with retractable landing gear, it was impossible to simply replace the wheels with skis, but the problem was solved anyway. How?
