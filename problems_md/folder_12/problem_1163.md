# Problem 1163. African surgery 

The “soldiers” of the nomadic ants of the genus Dorylus living in Africa are up to 13 mm long. These ants have powerful upper hook-shaped jaws - mandibles, which reflexively contract as soon as any foreign body gets between them. The indigenous inhabitants of the African continent learned to use this ant property for surgical purposes. How do they use this free natural resource?
