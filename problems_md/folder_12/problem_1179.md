# Problem 1179. “Let’s hit sloppiness with hard rock!”

During their concerts, the musicians of the American hard rock band Van Halen staged a show on stage using a variety of special effects, pyrotechnics and technically complex techniques. They went on tour with a large amount of their own stage equipment. At the same time, the band's rider specifically stipulated all the necessary technical nuances for high-quality and, most importantly, safe concerts. The rider also included one very simple point, by fulfilling which the band immediately determined how attentively the inviting party had treated all the other conditions put forward. How did the musicians find out that they were being met in a slipshod manner?
