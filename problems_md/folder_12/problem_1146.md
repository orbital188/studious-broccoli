# Problem 1146. “Planes against cruise missiles”

During World War II, the Germans actively bombed London with V-1 cruise missiles. The autopilot regulated the targeted flight of the rocket at a speed of 650 to 800 km/h. To protect against weapons unusual for that time, the British used balloons and anti-aircraft artillery. Most of all the neutralized missiles were aircraft. British air aces have learned to deal with cruise missiles without even using any weapons. How did they do this?
