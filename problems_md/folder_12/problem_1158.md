# Problem 1158. “The Word of God for lepers”

In the early Middle Ages, leprosy epidemics frequently occurred in Western Europe. In order to somehow prevent the spread of this infectious disease, in 1179 church authorities even adopted a special decree according to which those with leprosy were not allowed into churches. But sick people also wanted to find comfort in the Word of God. And the church constantly strived to increase its flock. Churchmen found a way for lepers to “attend” services. How did they do it?
