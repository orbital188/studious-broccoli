# Problem 1160. “Saw the bars! They’re gold!”

Gold bars are a convenient and common way to store savings not only for states, but also for individuals. For sale to private individuals, as a rule, measured bars weighing up to 1000 grams are offered. Specialists from the Swiss company Valcambi, which has been working in the gold market for a long time, thought about the fact that people who invest in gold bars sometimes need to convert gold back into money over time. Or, for example, give someone a “piece of gold.” At the same time, you don’t want to give or sell the entire bullion, but only a certain part of it. Valcambi has found a way to help its customers solve this problem. How did they do this?
