# Problem 1134. “A camel is terrible in anger”

Camels are widely used as pets in the East. The owners of these animals know that, despite their seemingly quiet and calm nature, they are actually very willful. And besides, they are vindictive. Naturally, the owner forces the camel to work, and in case of disobedience, he punishes the animal. But an angry camel is extremely dangerous. It can even injure its owner. How do owners manage to tame their violent pets?
