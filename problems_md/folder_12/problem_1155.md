# Problem 1155. Washington in London 

The first US President George Washington had a very negative attitude towards Great Britain. Once he even publicly declared that he would never set foot in London. More than a hundred years passed, and in 1924, for political reasons, the Americans decided to give London a statue of Washington. But what about the public wish of the first US president? How did the donors overcome the situation?
