# Problem 1191. “To the menagerie - without money”

From the 13th century until 1830, the Royal Tower Castle in London housed a menagerie of lions, leopards and other exotic animals for the entertainment of crowned heads. In the 16th century it was opened for a small fee to ordinary visitors. The money went mostly to food for the animals. In the 18th century, the keepers of the royal menagerie decided that any visitor could bring food for the lions. Therefore, the payment system for entering the menagerie was modified. How could visitors look at exotic predators without paying money?
