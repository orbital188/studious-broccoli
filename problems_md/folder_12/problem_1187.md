# Problem 1187. The cunning woodcock 

The woodcock is a small bird of the snipe family. It is mainly nocturnal. It chooses humid mixed forests in the temperate zone of Eurasia for this purpose. The woodcock feeds mainly on earthworms, which it searches for in the damp soil with its sharp long beak with very sensitive nerve endings. But it happens that during dry periods, earthworms sink deep into the ground, and the woodcock cannot reach them. In this case, the bird has a special technique to attract prey. How does the woodcock lure earthworms?
