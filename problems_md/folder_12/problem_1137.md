# Problem 1137. “Diplomatic incident”

In the capital of Iran, Tehran, on Winston Churchill Boulevard, the British Embassy was located for many years. But in 1981, the international community was shocked by the death of Bobby Sands, a political fighter for the separation of Ireland from Great Britain, as a result of a hunger strike. Tehran city authorities renamed Churchill Boulevard Bob Sands Street in solidarity with Irish nationalists. As a result, British diplomats in Iran found themselves in a rather delicate situation. Now any mail sent to the British Embassy will contain the name of a person who fought against Great Britain. How did diplomats manage to resolve this contradiction?
