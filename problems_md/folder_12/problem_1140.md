# Problem 1140. “Water cycle in the ocean”

The study of the flow and redistribution of water in the seas and oceans is very important for determining the state of the Earth's climate. Thus, in 1992, oceanographers were able to reliably establish, using irrefutable facts, that the water cycle between Japan, Alaska and the Aleutian Islands lasts approximately three years. How did scientists come to this conclusion?
