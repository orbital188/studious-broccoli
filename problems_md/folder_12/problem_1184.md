# Problem 1184. “Deception of war elephants”

In the Middle Ages in India, during fighting between tribes and peoples, specially trained war elephants were often used. Neither horsemen nor foot soldiers could resist them. But in the Marwar region, where the Rajput ethnic group lived, they found a way to camouflage horses in such a way that elephants simply refused to attack them. As a result, the horse unhinderedly came close to the elephant, stood on its forehead with its front legs, and the rider hit the elephant driver with a spear. How did the Rajputs manage to deceive war elephants? In the Middle Ages in India, during fighting between tribes and peoples, specially trained war elephants were often used.
