# Problem 1161. “Duel with infection”

At the beginning of the 19th century, a significant proportion of deaths during armed conflicts occurred not so much from gunshot wounds, but from infectious diseases that entered the wounds along with scraps of clothing. Military doctors knew this well. In 1806, a retired English army surgeon named Humphrey Howard once quarreled with the Earl of Barrymore in London. A duel was scheduled. Assuming a possible unsuccessful outcome of the duel for himself, Humphrey Howard took certain measures to prevent the contagious infection from getting into a possible gunshot wound. How was Humphrey able to protect himself?
