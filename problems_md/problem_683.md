# Problem 863. “Russian merchants against English merchants”

In the 18th century, Russian merchants fought with English merchants for trade in the Persian market. Mostly sugar was brought to Iran, and carpets were exported. Once the Astrakhan merchant Grigory Safrazovich Khodzheminasov, whose name was simply Safras, also brought a whole shipload of sugar. But it turned out that there were already three English ships in the port with the same cargo. The British set their price at 10 Iranian tomans for a product that was of lower quality. A price fight has begun. And Safras managed to outwit his competitors, sell his sugar for 11 tomans and earn significant money from the trade. How did he do it?
