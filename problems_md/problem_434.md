# Problem 559. “Genuine fake”

An Austrian museum decided to buy a painting by a famous artist in France. Its authenticity was confirmed by a group of competent experts. In their presence, the notary put a stamp on the back of the canvas, certifying the authenticity of the painting. In the Austrian museum, where it was delivered with all precautions, a second examination was carried out. It turned out that the painting was a fake. How could this happen? Note that a group of French experts correctly established that the painting was original. The notary immediately stamped it, and the seal was not copied. This was definitely established in Austria.
