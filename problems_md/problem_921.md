# Problem 1151. Unclear words

With the development of the Internet, the need arose to convert old paper books into electronic format. An automated computer system scans an image of a printed page and independently recognizes letters and words. But quite often it happens that the system is not able to recognize a particular word, especially if it has fallen out of widespread use or is, for example, a professional term. Then a “living” person has to “decipher” the image. This greatly delays the process of digitizing books. But the owners of some specialized sites have found a way to “force” their visitors to translate words that are incomprehensible to a machine into a digestible form. How do they do this?
