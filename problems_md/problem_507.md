# Problem 638. “The slave as a witness”

In Ancient Rome, a slave was equated with property that entirely belonged to the master. He had no rights, including legal ones. According to Roman law, in court, the testimony of a slave against the master was not taken into account - it was the same as the testimony of the master against himself. But sometimes cases against the state had to be heard in court. For Rome, the state was above all else. The testimony of a slave was necessary to expose a state criminal. But you can’t break the law either! What should Roman judges do?
