# Problem 943. Club-footed dancers 

In the Belarusian town of Smorgon in the last century there was a “bear academy”, where club-footed artists were taught various hilarious things. In nature, bears sometimes stand on their hind legs if necessary, so it was not a problem for the “learned bear” to consolidate this skill. But how can you teach a bear not only to stand on its hind legs, but also to dance?
