# Problem 1180. “Nazis at a symphony concert”

During World War II, Norway was occupied by the Nazis. The Norwegian Nazis were looking for Jews living in the country. At that time, the violinist, Jewish by birth, Ernst Glaser played in the capital's Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Herald Heide. In 1941, right during a concert, a group of Nazis burst into the Philharmonic hall, who wanted to grab Glaser right there on stage in order to betray him to the occupation authorities. But the orchestra conductor forced the attackers to stop. This bought time, and Glaser disappeared backstage. How was Herald Heide able to stop the Nazis?
