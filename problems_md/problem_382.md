# Problem 497. “A spoonful of buzz in a barrel of honey”

Peruvian customs officers have noticed that almost every day trucks with cans full of honey cross the border with Ecuador. Why do Ecuadorians need so much imported honey if their beekeeping business is normal? One can was sent for examination. There was cocaine in the honey. However, the drug was not mechanically mixed into the honey - the honey itself somehow acquired narcotic properties. You can eat and have fun. But how could such honey come about? Propose and justify your hypotheses.
