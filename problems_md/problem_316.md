# Problem 396. “New signs”

In one city, a new district of 100 houses was built. Sign makers made and brought a pack of new signs with the numbering of houses from 1 to 100. Count the number of all the numbers 9 found in these signs (numbers 9 and 6 are different numbers). Source: Creative association “Flight of Thought” (Chelyabinsk)
