# Problem 1365. “Ants in the hotel”

Vacationers in Egypt at different times in different hotels, the boxer and the biologist encountered the same trouble. As soon as the sun set, ants began to crawl into the room from the crack under the balcony door. Having discovered this, the boxer and his son beat the stubborn crawling insects with slippers for three nights in a row, after which they pointed out the problem to the manager and moved to another hotel. When a biologist vacationing with his wife discovered ants in his room, he dealt with the problem that same night using available means, and the insects did not bother the couple until the end of their vacation. How did a biologist deal with “night” ants?
