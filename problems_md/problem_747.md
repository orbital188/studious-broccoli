# Problem 938. “Gold for the Beggars”

One day, the slave and philosopher Aesop once again helped his master Xanthus “get away with it.” As a reward, the owner gave Aesop a golden cup from his table. But Xanthus did not like the fact that Aesop wanted to sell the cup and give the money to the poor. He put forward a condition to Aesop: “The cup is yours, you own it by right, but as soon as you sell it, you must return the money received to me.” Aesop resolved the contradiction: he fulfilled the owner’s condition - he returned the money for the sold cup and at the same time distributed the money to the poor. Find this solution too.
