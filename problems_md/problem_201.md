# Problem 259. “Dropped a bolt and a ball”

In machines for producing liquid helium, the most important part is the expander. It is a vertically standing pipe, about three meters high and about ten centimeters in diameter. One day, a rubber ball, an iron bolt and a copper nut were dropped into this pipe in turn. How did you get these items? Source: Creative association “Flight of Thought” (Chelyabinsk)
