# Problem 203. “Test chamber”

There is an installation for testing long-term effects of acids on samples (cubes) of alloys. This is a sealed metal chamber.  Cubes are placed at the bottom and an aggressive liquid is poured, creating the necessary temperature and pressure in the chamber.  The acid (liquid) acts on the cubes. Weight loss or surface damage characterizes the stability of alloy samples. But the acid also acts on the walls of the chamber, causing them to corrode and destroy.  The camera has to be made using precious metals, which is very expensive. How to reduce the impact of aggressive liquid on the walls of the test chamber? Source: Sat. CRISIS - CNTI, 1992, p. 59
