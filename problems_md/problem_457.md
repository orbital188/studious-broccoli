# Problem 585. “Concubine in the house”

Chinese parable. One smart young man lost his parents early and lived under the tutelage of his uncle. One day his uncle told the young man that he was worried that he did not have a son. To take care of the male offspring, he should take a concubine into the house, but his wife does not want this. The young man thought for a while and then said: “Uncle, don’t be sad anymore.” I see a way to get my aunt’s consent. What did the smart young man do? Source: Harro von Senger “Stratagems”
