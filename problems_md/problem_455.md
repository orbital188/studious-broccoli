# Problem 582. “How to bypass the sedative law?”

Many American states have adopted “calming” laws. They allow customers to cancel a product within a few days after purchasing it and get all their money back. Such laws seriously hit companies that heavily push their products to consumers. Yielding to “pressure” tactics, people often make a purchase not because they need the product, but because they are fooled or intimidated. When the new laws came into effect, many customers began returning purchases. What can companies do to reduce the flow of product returns without changing the usual and effective tactics of “pressing” customers?
