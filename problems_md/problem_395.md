# Problem 513. “Clean the headlights”

In wet weather, the surface of the car headlight glass becomes dirty. This greatly reduces visibility at night. You can, of course, get out of the car and wipe the headlights. But this won't last long. Mechanical wipers can be installed, but they are complex and unreliable. Water nozzles are uneconomical and cannot remove contaminants with increased adhesion. What to do? Any suggestions?
