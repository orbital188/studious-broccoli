# Problem 476. “Cleaning the sea surface from oil”

There are many ways to eliminate oil spilled in the sea. For example, magnetic powder is added to the spilled oil - this allows the spilled oil to be collected with a magnet. This makes the equipment more complex. When the oil film is treated with absorbents, the oil stops spreading over the sea surface, but the absorbents are expensive, poisonous, and over time they release the oil back into the water. It is necessary to use inexpensive and accessible materials to clean the sea surface from the oil film without complicating the equipment. What solutions can there be?
