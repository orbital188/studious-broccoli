# Problem 314. “Armenian dollars”

In Soviet times - around the seventies - during the Cold War - several wealthy Armenians wanted to leave the USSR for the USA. They had already received documents to leave, but they had a problem - how to take out their cash dollars. And they had saved up a lot of dollars. They, of course, knew that things would be inspected at customs with special care. And therefore it was impossible to conduct dollars in this way. But they still found a way to take their wealth abroad. Offer ideas on how they were able to solve their problem.
