Problem 1. “Where do the exhibits disappear?”,"In the historical and local history museum of the Ural city of Katav-Ivanovsk, exhibits disappear without a trace: they are simply devoured by hungry rats. At first they took a liking to stuffed birds and small animals, and now they have started on the bear. What should museum employees do?",https://www.trizland.ru/tasks/1241/
Problem 2. “Is Old Man Hottabych to blame?”,"Anyone who has read one fairy tale remembers that Old Man Hottabych “rooted” for his favorite football team. But he received a scolding from his venerable master Volka ibn Alyosha for the devastating expense. Hottabych then had to instantly infect all members of the losing team with measles. As a result, the result of the match was canceled. So what? History repeats itself. In September 1998, an American football match took place between the teams: Duke University and the Blue Devils (Florida). And the result? On the same day, all the players came down with a severe viral disorder stomach. It’s interesting that Old Man Hottabych was not present at this match... I would like to find out the reason for such an unexpected incident. Your versions?",https://www.trizland.ru/tasks/1777/
Problem 4. “Reflective network”,"As studies have shown, the threads of the web best reflect ultraviolet rays, and ultraviolet is a signal of clear skies, and gullible insects rush there. However, if the web is illuminated, it will simply be visible, and not a single self-respecting fly will head to certain death. How did they solve this problem and how do they lure the victim into their networks?",https://www.trizland.ru/tasks/1626/
Problem 5. Network on the horizon,"Forest. Spider networks. Some of them are located horizontally. But it is not clear why this was done. After all, insects no longer fly up and down, but horizontally. By the way, it is interesting that the owner himself walks upside down on such a network. So: Why is the network located horizontally? Why does the spider walk upside down on such a network? Suggest hypotheses.",https://www.trizland.ru/tasks/1627/
Problem 6. “Repairing networks”,"Spiders weave webs at night or early in the morning. Moreover, these networks do not last long. Why? It’s just that in dry air the sticky substance changes its consistency and the strength of the network decreases. Beetles, bumblebees and other large insects tear apart the web. Therefore, after one or two nights the spider has to renew the network. Such weak networks need to be constantly repaired, and this leads to a large consumption of building material. So you won’t get enough material. How did spiders solve this problem?",https://www.trizland.ru/tasks/1628/
Problem 7. Signal network,"Oh, World of Smells! Oh, World of light and color! Oh, the World of sounds!.. The worlds in which we live. What about the World of touch? In this world, a person does not feel very confident - there are no developed organs. Spiders live in the World of Touch. At the tips of their legs, spiders have extremely sensitive organs of touch. The arachnoid network is, as it were, a tactile organ of an insect carried far from the body, transmitting information. However, there are always many influences on the web - the influence of wind and rain, the influence of large animals and insects. I wonder how a spider obtains the necessary information from a large number of influences on the web? Why doesn't he rush at every movement of the net?",https://www.trizland.ru/tasks/1629/
Problem 8. “Spiders in a flock”,"Swarms of spiders. Do they exist in nature? If so, why do spiders flock together? Surely, just like, for example, wolves, they flock together in order to hunt for large prey. It is known that such spiders exist in nature, and they jointly hunt for insects that they cannot cope with alone. However, in order to hunt in concert, they need a communication system. This is good for wolves - they have well-developed vision and hearing. And spiders have only one wealth - the web. Spiders living in groups use special web threads to disseminate information to all their relatives. In this case, the signal threads are quite long and therefore need to be secured somewhere. But a thread attached to a support cannot transmit vibrations. What about spiders?",https://www.trizland.ru/tasks/1631/
Problem 9. “A fly for lunch”,"Big fly for lunch. It is so beautiful! For a spider. However, spiders are small insects. Spiders differ from other arthropods in that their body is divided into two parts. The head is fused with the chest and, with the help of a thin part, is connected to the tummy. This part of the spider's body contains the lungs, liver, heart, ovaries and digestive tract. But the latter is very small, and the fly is big. I wonder how the spider eats a fly that would not fit inside the spider?",https://www.trizland.ru/tasks/1632/
Problem 11. Spider Bell Underwater ,"Spiders living underwater need to transport a large bubble of air from the surface of the water to the depths. This is easy to say but difficult to do, since air is much lighter than water and tends to rise. In addition, it is necessary to quickly and accurately find its home. What should a spider do?",https://www.trizland.ru/tasks/1634/
Problem 13. Spiders vs. Bees ,"Some spiders cause trouble for humans. The labyrinth spider living in the meadows weaves its webs so diligently that it sometimes destroys many bees. Beekeepers value bees, but spiders are also useful and should not be poisoned. What do you recommend beekeepers do?",https://www.trizland.ru/tasks/1243/
Problem 15. Checking drugs,"Every day new drugs are synthesized around the world. All of them must be checked. Most often, the effects of drugs are tested on different animals.

Problem 26. “Recognition at the cost of life”,"Aleksandar Hemon's novel The Lazarus Project describes the situation of a photojournalist named Rora at a checkpoint in Sarajevo during the war between Orthodox Serbs and Muslims. “In one of the Chetniks, Rora recognized his pre-war poker partner... Rora recognized him by his eyes - he more than once looked intently into these eyes at a card table littered with the currencies of different countries. The name of the former gambler was Zloyutro; and he immediately recognized Rora. I checked his pass, looked at his face and sternly shook his head: they say, do you think I’m a fool, or what? And he asked: “Who are you, anyway?” Rora could have lied and called himself a Serb, but the Chetnik knew that this was not true; if Rora had admitted that he was a Muslim, he could have been accused of espionage - in either case, he would have been in trouble. And Rora said: “What did the photojournalist answer to get out of the sticky situation?",https://www.trizland.ru/tasks/5038/

Problem 28. Niels Bohr Medal,"In 1943, the greatest physicist of the 20th century, Nobel Prize winner in 1922, Niels Bohr, hiding under an assumed name, was forced to flee Nazi-occupied Denmark. The fishermen secretly transported him by boat to Sweden. You were not allowed to take any valuables with you. And even more so, a gold medal from a Nobel laureate, which, in the event of an unsuccessful operation, could immediately betray the scientist. Simply hiding the medal somewhere in Copenhagen or handing it over to someone for safekeeping was dangerous, unreliable and there was no time - there was a war going on... And yet, returning a few years later from the USA to Denmark after the war, Bohr received his medal in its original form. How did he do it?",https://www.trizland.ru/tasks/5041/
Problem 29. “How to get a tip?”,"After the reunification of Germany (Western and Eastern), restaurant owners in Florida (USA) began to have difficulties with German tourists. Interesting: Germany united, but problems arose in an American restaurant. Why suddenly? It's simple: East Germans began to travel and “drop in” to this very Florida restaurant. They just didn’t know how much it was customary to tip. And they inadvertently underpaid tips - unlike the West Germans, who knew the accepted rules and did it regularly. And who wants to miss out on their income? So the waiters began to think - what to do? West Germans, of course, give the required amount of tips themselves, and East Germans... can be included in the bill. You just need to “sort” West Germans from East Germans, and not offend any of them. How to do it?",https://www.trizland.ru/tasks/1775/

Problem 32. “Railway against homeowners”,"In 1938, twenty homeowners in Baltimore, USA, sued the Pennsylvania Railroad, claiming that vibrations caused by passing trains were damaging the walls, ceilings and plaster of their homes. The houses stood along the street along which the railroad track ran. Several trains passed through it every day. Heavy trucks also drove along the street, but the process was organized only against the railway. And although representatives of the railway company were sure that the accusations were incorrect, they had no opportunity to refute them in court. Moreover, the jury members were not seismography specialists, but ordinary citizens. How can you clearly prove that vibration from passing trains does not destroy nearby houses?",https://www.trizland.ru/tasks/5048/

Problem 43. “Don’t get caught in your own network”,"The circular web of spiders has amazed more than one generation of scientists and artists with its form and practicality. It is also good from a technical point of view: a relatively large area is covered with the least amount of spider silk. At the same time, the net is elastic and at the same time strong: it can withstand gusts of wind and jerks from struggling prey. To securely hold the prey, the net must be sufficiently sticky. But how then does the spider running on the web not stick to its own trap?",https://www.trizland.ru/tasks/1258/
Problem 44. “How do they steal purebred dogs?”,"Purebred dogs are expensive. Everyone knows this. Crooks too.

In what ways can a dog that the owner let go for a walk be taken away?",https://www.trizland.ru/tasks/1259/
Problem 45. “Hull – in half”,"Sometimes small things lead to serious accidents. For example, in the history of maritime disasters there is a curious case. The ship carrying peas received a small hole. Only one compartment of the hold was flooded, which did not pose a danger. However, this ship sank - the ship's hull was torn in half.

Problem 51. “Naked in winter”,"For living beings, warm winter shoes are a natural phenomenon. Another surprising thing is that some animals and birds do not start anything for themselves before winter. Take a closer look at the pigeons, what are they wearing as they splash around in the snow? Of course, the skin on the paws is much thicker than on other parts of the body, and is also covered with scales. But such skin cannot save you from the cold. How do birds dressed so frivolously manage to safely endure harsh winters?",https://www.trizland.ru/tasks/1638/
Problem 55. “How a sparrow flies”,"How do sparrows fly in a very strong wind, considering that this bird does not fly, but jumps along the trajectory of its flight? They cannot stay in flight for long, because the heart cannot stand it - it will “break.” An example of this weakness is very well known when China tried to get rid of sparrows that were eating their rice crops.

Problem 58. “Asphalt road without bitumen”,"Asphalt consists mainly of sand and bitumen. Bitumen (similar to black tar) is one of the products that is obtained from petroleum. To build one kilometer of asphalt road, the amount of bitumen required is equal to that produced from 320 barrels of oil. Oil is expensive. And if you need to build, for example, 87 thousand kilometers of asphalt roads, the cost of bitumen will cost a pretty penny. Bitumen has another undesirable effect: this material is dangerous for the environment. How else can grains of sand be bonded together to get a cheap and an asphalt-like road surface that is safe for nature? Suggest a solution.",https://www.trizland.ru/tasks/5054/
Problem 62. The Gardener's Revenge ,"In the garden of a certain sage there lived a magnificent peacock. The bird was the gardener's delight. He nurtured and cherished her.

The gardener saw this and became very angry. But the neighbor decided to flatter the gardener and asked him to give him one chick. The gardener flatly refused. Then the neighbor humbly turned to the owner with a request to give one peacock egg to put on the hen, and she would hatch the chick. The owner asked the gardener to give his neighbor an egg from a peacock clutch. The gardener complied with the command. After some time, an angry neighbor came to the owner with a complaint: “There is something wrong with the egg, my hens sat on it for weeks, but the chick did not hatch.” The owner called the gardener: “You gave our neighbor an egg.

Problem 68. “Wet goose?”,"Australian naturalist K. Lorenz conducted an experiment: he took goslings that had just hatched from eggs in an incubator, and began to walk with them instead of the goose. It turned out that the feathers of goslings left without a mother get wet in water, while the feathers of goslings with their mother do not get wet. Why?

The echolocation system of cetaceans is perfect. Thus, a dolphin emits sounds with a frequency from 49 to 170 kilohertz. If he makes low-frequency sounds, he has a general, vague image of his surroundings. If he needs a clearer image, he increases the frequency. And it can distinguish, for example, small balls of barely different diameters. The dolphin's echolocation allows it to see every fish in the school that it hunts.

Power lines usually contain up to 70 dead birds, which, by the way, have long been listed in the Red Book. In the city of Zhigulevsk (Kuibyshev region) there are few trees and material for nests. After power lines appeared there, crows and jackdaws took a fancy to them and began to settle in, carrying pieces of wire and mesh from factories and warehouses.

Sundakov writes about his acquaintance with the Tushaua Indian tribe: “The “children of the Moon” liked learning to fight without weapons, playing new games and drawing most of all. The sun was sinking into the jungle. I sat next to an adult warrior named Karakua. In the hands of the Indian is a knife (a small stick, extended by a firmly tied bone, part of a monkey’s rib). Using a knife, the warrior sharpened the tip of the “raffak” - a large double-edged arrowhead. Having finished his work, he deftly transferred the tip to his right hand and suddenly, with a sharp movement, imitated a blow to my chest. Before I could appreciate his joke, my hands automatically performed the usual movement. The Karakua tip flew off to the side, and its owner, poking the back of his head into my knee, froze in an unnatural position. His exclamation of surprise and pain in his wrist attracted the attention of other warriors, and soon I was surrounded by a dense ring of men who wanted to see this and then other simple hand-to-hand combat techniques again and again. The types of weapons changed. Arrows (“cherekave”), used as spears, and a heavy club were also used. Then the fight partners began to change. Stronger warriors rose up to replace those who were falling under the general cries and shrill laughter of their fellow tribesmen. The culmination was the action, the reason for which was my proposal to attack everyone at the same time. I would give a lot to look at it from the outside. Energetically, but as carefully as possible, I again and again freed myself from hot and wet bodies, jumped and tumbled on the damp ground trampled by my bare feet, “working” in passive defense mode, mainly freeing myself from grips and using the strength of the most active opponents against the rest.

But at high temperature, the solution decomposes, the metal falls out on the walls of the bath, “the solution becomes cloudy,” and the quality of metallization deteriorates. The solution quickly loses its working properties and has to be changed frequently. Up to 75% of chemicals go to waste (or “recycling”), which increases the cost of the process.

Problem 133. Raising sunken ships,"There are various methods for raising sunken ships. The main method is to use pontoons. These are steel cylindrical containers with a volume of 50 to 500 m3. Sometimes soft pontoons made of multi-layer rubberized fabric are used. Divers at the bottom use hydraulic panels to clean the channels under the hull of the sunken ship, and through these channels they pull cables to which the water-filled (and submerged) pontoons are attached. Then, compressors from the rescue vessel supply compressed air through hoses, displacing water from the pontoons. The pontoons gain lift and float, lifting the ship upward. The method is complex and is applicable only at shallow depths, where divers can work. Another method: a diver runs a hose into the compartment of a sunken ship, and light polystyrene foam balls are pumped into the ship.  The balls displace some of the water, giving the ship buoyancy.  This method is also applicable at shallow depths (for example, it was used to quickly raise a barge with sheep that sank in a bay near a large city to prevent contamination of the water in the bay). The method requires complex equipment. Hungarian inventor László Saszko came up with the idea of ​​displacing water from pontoons (or the hold of a ship) with hydrogen obtained by electrolysis of sea water. He also suggested attaching pontoons to the ship with magnets.  There is no certainty that the magnetic fastening will be sufficiently reliable (and hydrogen is a safe gas...). Let us now formulate the problem: propose a method for lifting a sunken ship from great depths at which it is impossible to use the labor of divers. For simplicity, we will assume that the ship lies level on solid ground. The weight of the ship in the water is 2000 tons. The holds are filled with cargo, for example, ore.  Let us take the depth to be 500 m.

The vapor product evaporates and is collected in the condenser (refrigerator) in the form of a white powder. To increase the productivity of this column, they tried to increase the supply of bromine steam.  At the same time, heat was released above the permissible level, the aluminum melted (Tm = 660°C).  In addition, it turned out that at elevated temperatures an admixture of monobromoaluminum AlBr is formed, which, when cooled, decomposes to release the metal: 3 AlBr = (cold) => AlBr3 + 2 Al.

Such a preparation, after being calcined at 300-400°C, is suitable for measuring the amount of metal in radiometric or x-ray analysis methods. To do this, they usually proceed as follows: a portion of a solution in kerosene is mixed with an aqueous solution of such a chemical composition (P-1), which is well known in the chemical laboratory and promotes almost complete transition into an aqueous solution (with 2-3 repetitions of contact by stirring two immiscible phases). After separation, this aqueous solution is diluted with another aqueous solution (P-2), the composition of which promotes almost complete and rapid electrodeposition of a metal hydroxide film on the cathode. The stage of transferring into an aqueous solution from a solution in kerosene requires manual work for 1-2 hours. The electrodeposition stage takes 15-20 minutes. Disadvantages of this known method: its multi-stage nature and duration, the need to dilute the first aqueous solution (R-1) at least 10 times with the second solution (R-2), because of this there are significant losses metal of the original sample due to dilution.

Problem 407. “Coke deposits on catalysts”,"The production of benzene from its less valuable alkyl derivatives is carried out by the hydrodealkylation reaction - by reaction with hydrogen: CH3C6H5 + H2 = C6H6 + CH4. The process is carried out at a temperature of 700-800°C without a catalyst under a pressure of 20-70 atm (2-7 MPa). The disadvantage of this method is the use of expensive heat-resistant steel grades. During the process, coke is deposited on the reactor walls, which reduces the heat transfer coefficient, so the temperature of the reactor walls has to be increased more so that the reaction mixture reaches the required temperature. The use of catalysts containing chromium or noble metals allows the temperature to be reduced by 100°C. But coke is also deposited on the catalysts (as a result of a side reaction). Coke deposition deactivates the catalyst. To regenerate the catalyst, the process is interrupted, the reactor is cooled, blown with cold air to remove hydrocarbons, the coke is burned off by blowing hot air, cooled, blown with hydrocarbons, heated again and the process is continued with the activated catalyst.

How did the Tuaregs manage to resolve this contradiction, since there are no trees in the desert from which sword handles could be made?",https://www.trizland.ru/tasks/5578/
Problem 1128. “At the dawn of the Internet”,"At the very beginning of the 1970s, with the development of the Internet in the United States, it was primarily government agencies that gained access to the future World Wide Web.

Minefield! ,"For many years - and still - unexploded mines and shells that have remained in the ground since the Second World War and after other armed conflicts are found from time to time in different places. Detected ammunition is usually exploded in safe places. Sometimes it is known in advance that in a certain place at one time there was a fairly extensive mined area. For sappers, it is easier in such places to detonate the ammunition all at once right on the spot, taking people to a safe distance.

Problem 1132. “An incident at the border”,"The city of Lourdes in France is famous for the miracles that occur there. One of its main attractions is a spring with “holy” water, for which devout Catholics come from all over the world. One foreigner who visited Lourdes was crossing customs. “What will you declare?” – the customs officer asked him. “I don’t have anything to declare.” “What’s in this bottle?” - the next question from the customs officer. - Holy water from Lourdes.

One day he learned that a hawker selling small goods would be passing through the village where his family lived. The teacher decided to transfer money with him. The peddler agreed to take it only on one condition: he would give her as much of this money as he wanted. The teacher guessed that the peddler was going to pocket most of the amount, so he gave a note to his wife along with the money. But he was also sure that his wife, having received the money and read the note, would not reconcile herself and would take the peddler to the local rabbi to resolve the dispute. That's exactly what happened. And the teacher’s wife received from the peddler almost all the money that her husband gave her.

Many companies began to build multi-story buildings and even compete to see whose house would be the tallest. To win this unofficial competition of prestige, the builders of the house at 40 Wall Street changed the design already during the construction process, increasing the height of several winning meters. Their closest competitors, the builders of the Chrysler Building, found out about this and also made adjustments to the project.

Problem 1145. Children's strikes ,"During the Second World War, Canada had fixed prices for consumer goods. After the war, prices were “released.” This led to inflation.

In the spring of 1947, Canadian children and teenagers, with the tacit consent of adults, began to independently organize public boycotts and peaceful demonstrations near grocery stores across the country. The producers of sweets suffered the most from these actions. But, if you can somehow explain to adults the conditioned rise in prices, is it not so easy to “calm down” children?

An automated computer system scans an image of a printed page and independently recognizes letters and words. But quite often it happens that the system is not able to recognize a particular word, especially if it has fallen out of widespread use or is, for example, a professional term. Then a “living” person has to “decipher” the image. This greatly delays the process of digitizing books.

King resorted to a trick: he began publishing novels under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. But in 1984, one “advanced” bookstore salesman suspected the similarity of the literary styles of Bachman and King and, after digging through the Library of Congress, brought the real author to light.

This corresponded to second place. The judges were faced with a question: who to give preference to? As a result, the silver medal went to Nishida, and the bronze medal to Oe. Why is this so? According to one version, the judges simply tossed a coin to distribute the medals. According to another version, the Japanese Athletics Federation took into account that Nishida took the height on the first attempt, and Oe on the second. However, the athletes themselves were not satisfied with the judges' decision. Obeying traditional Japanese courtesy, with equal results, both Nishida and Oe were ready to concede victory to each other.

In the air at high speeds, the nose of the aircraft rose to increase aerodynamics, and the pilot controlled the machine using instruments. During takeoff and landing, the nose lowered to provide visibility from the pilot's cabin.

The newlyweds in love had previously lived in different cities and were very worried that the girl would not be given citizenship. So they turned to a consultant. He told them that the most important thing was the behavior of the spouses in the hall while waiting for an appointment, when experienced American psychologists were watching them on video cameras.

Problem 1353. “Empty tubes”,"At a toothpaste manufacturing plant, a problem was discovered: the conveyor sometimes malfunctioned and produced empty tubes. It was not possible to eliminate the cause of the problem with high-tech equipment on our own, so management turned to an engineering company.

Every time the scale showed a deviation from the norm, the siren turned on and the conveyor stopped. The worker manually removed the defective tubes and started the unit again. This had to be done quite often.

For 161 kilometers, the Suez Canal has no locks. Therefore, the only way to block it is to hit a large ship directly on the fairway line. But British anti-aircraft artillery does not allow Italian planes to approach passing ships. Then the Italians changed tactics and began dropping magnetic mines into the water when the canal was empty, in the hope that the ship would “pick up” a mine while moving. The British, in turn, placed observers along the shore who counted the dropped mines, carefully searched for them at the bottom and pulled them out of the water with trawls. Naturally, while the mines were in the water and there was a threat of explosion, British ships did not enter the Suez Canal. The Italians from Rommel’s corps decided to turn this time factor to their advantage and, along with real magnetic mines, began to throw dummies into the canal. At the same time, the dummies were made in such a way that British search engines did not find them and were constantly at a loss as to whether there were mines in the canal or not.
